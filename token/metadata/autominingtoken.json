The AMT facilitates the investment in bitcoin mining, because it assumes all the operational and bureaucratic part of the activity. Investors in AMT do not have to worry about buying, importing and maintaining mining machines, nor do they have to worry about renting space, machine cooling equipment, employee salaries, taxes, high electricity costs. It is up to the investor to just buy and hold the AMT token, verifying their daily bitcoin yields increase, as programmed in the project's smart contracts."},"links":{"homepage":["https://autominingtoken.com/","https://autominingtoken.com/team-en/","https://autominingtoken.com/how-it-works-en/"],"blockchain_site":["https://bscscan.com/token/0x6Ae0A238a6f51Df8eEe084B1756A54dD8a8E85d3","","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["https://www.instagram.com/autominingtoken/","http://blog.autominingtoken.com/","https://www.tiktok.com/@autominingtoken"],"chat_url":["","",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"autominingtoken","facebook_username":null,"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"autominingtokenbr","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/AutoMiningToken"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/28918/thumb/AMT_-_Logo.png?1675392338","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/28918/small/AMT_-_Logo.png?1675392338","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/28918/large/AMT_-_Logo.png?1675392338"},"country_origin":null,"genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0x6ae0a238a6f51df8eee084b1756a54dd8a8e85d3","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":45,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":null,"coingecko_score":0,"developer_score":0,"community_score":0,"liquidity_score":0,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-05-18T05:50:22.811Z"}
