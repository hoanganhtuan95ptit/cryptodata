There are three other co-founders who serves on different positions in LRBY Inc: Alex Grintsvayg (Chief Technical Officer), Josh Finer (Director of Operations and Analytics), and Jack Robison (Protocol Developer).\r\n\r\nLBRY provides its own official app, which can be used to store LBC. The LBRY app is available for multiple operating systems such as Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Android and iOS versions are still in development. Other than its official LBRY wallet, users can opt for the Coinomi mobile wallet, which is recommended by LBRY. LBC can only be obtained through exchange. Users can also take advantage of LBC mining and various rewards given in LBC coin by LBRY network to its users.\r\n\r\nAlthough the concept behind the LBRY network has a lot of potential for growth, it faces competition directly against the entertainment giants such as YouTube and Netflix, and some of these platforms have been around for more than a decade."},"links":{"homepage":["https://lbry.com","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://explorer.lbry.com/","","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://www.facebook.com/LBRYcom/","",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"lbrycom","facebook_username":"lbrycom","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":1541268,"telegram_channel_identifier":"","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/lbry","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/lbryio/lbry"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/463/thumb/lbc.png?1631512541","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/463/small/lbc.png?1631512541","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/463/large/lbc.png?1631512541"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":"2016-06-23","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":71.43,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":28.57,"watchlist_portfolio_users":11735,"market_cap_rank":1126,"coingecko_rank":109,"coingecko_score":44.456,"developer_score":85.923,"community_score":38,"liquidity_score":11.144,"public_interest_score":0.008,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":33459,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[{"description":"The SEC is attempting to make nearly all cryptocurrencies illegal.
