We are here to tell the other side of the story and give \"teh\" people an opportunity to make a choice.\r\nYes, you, \"teh\" people reading this.\r\nDo you choose to continue to be ruled by the Shiba Inu and their corrupt ecosystem or do you want to make a stand, make a change.\r\nWe promise a vision that was initially set out. No ecosystem, no control of power, no authority. A pure outlook on how decentralization should be. A community in control of what they want to achieve and the decisions they make. An opportunity to fight, together, for real change and to take down Shiba Inu."},"links":{"homepage":["https://www.shadowcats.xyz/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x0018d5e01e53878f90feab02f1b2019a21adf8b1","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x0018d5e01e53878f90feab02f1b2019a21adf8b1","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["","https://medium.com/@shadowcatstokenerc",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"ShadowcatsErc","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"Shadowcatseth","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/29140/thumb/Shadowcats.png?1676963378","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/29140/small/Shadowcats.png?1676963378","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/29140/large/Shadowcats.png?1676963378"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0x0018d5e01e53878f90feab02f1b2019a21adf8b1","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":71,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":null,"coingecko_score":0,"developer_score":0,"community_score":0,"liquidity_score":0,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-14T03:49:49.884Z"}
