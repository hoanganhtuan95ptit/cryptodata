The FANTOM platform adopts a new protocol known as the “Lachesis Protocol” to maintain consensus. This protocol is intended to be integrated into the Fantom OPERA Chain. The aim is to allow applications built on top of the FANTOM OPERA Chain to enjoy instant transactions and near zero transaction costs for all users. \r\n\r\nThe mission of FANTOM is to provide compatibility between all transaction bodies around the world, and create an ecosystem which allows real-time transactions and data sharing with low cost."},"links":{"homepage":["http://fantom.foundation","",""],"blockchain_site":["http://ftmscan.com/","https://www.oklink.com/ftm","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["https://www.weibo.com/FantomFoundation","",""],"chat_url":["https://open.kakao.com/o/gkxyDLK","http://chat.fantom.network/","https://t.me/fantom_korean"],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"FantomFDN","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"fantom_english","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/FantomFoundation/","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/Fantom-foundation/go-lachesis"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4001/thumb/Fantom_round.png?1669652346","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4001/small/Fantom_round.png?1669652346","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4001/large/Fantom_round.png?1669652346"},"country_origin":"BS","genesis_date":null,"sentiment_votes_up_percentage":84.21,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":15.79,"ico_data":{"ico_start_date":"2018-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","ico_end_date":"2018-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","short_desc":"Beyond Blockchain","description":null,"links":{},"softcap_currency":"","hardcap_currency":"USD","total_raised_currency":"USD","softcap_amount":null,"hardcap_amount":"39400000.0","total_raised":"39650000.0","quote_pre_sale_currency":"","base_pre_sale_amount":null,"quote_pre_sale_amount":null,"quote_public_sale_currency":"USD","base_public_sale_amount":1,"quote_public_sale_amount":0.03,"accepting_currencies":"","country_origin":"BS","pre_sale_start_date":null,"pre_sale_end_date":null,"whitelist_url":"","whitelist_start_date":null,"whitelist_end_date":null,"bounty_detail_url":"","amount_for_sale":null,"kyc_required":true,"whitelist_available":null,"pre_sale_available":null,"pre_sale_ended":false},"watchlist_portfolio_users":268302,"market_cap_rank":55,"coingecko_rank":35,"coingecko_score":52.89,"developer_score":63.166,"community_score":42.748,"liquidity_score":62.645,"public_interest_score":0.009,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":110001,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[{"description":"Releasing our latest technical update, with progress on Go-lachesis performance, Fantom Finance #DeFi, our PWA Wallet, and the new Special Fee Contract. $FTM\r\n\r\nhttps://fantom.foundation/fantom-technical-update-12th-august-2020/","category":"general","created_at":"2020-08-12T12:05:55.612Z","user":"Connor Hughes","user_title":"Marketing Manager","pin":false,"project":{"type":"Coin","id":"fantom","name":"Fantom","symbol":"ftm","image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4001/thumb/Fantom_round.png?1669652346","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4001/small/Fantom_round.png?1669652346","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4001/large/Fantom_round.png?1669652346"}}},{"description":"A more detailed look at why Smart Medicine is a use case we're keen to push forward with, following our recent collaboration with Afghanistan's Ministry of Public Health.\r\n\r\n$FTM \r\n\r\nhttps://fantom.foundation/tracking-medical-products-on-fantom/","category":"general","created_at":"2020-08-10T13:43:27.088Z","user":"Connor Hughes","user_title":"Marketing Manager","pin":false,"project":{"type":"Coin","id":"fantom","name":"Fantom","symbol":"ftm","image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4001/thumb/Fantom_round.png?1669652346","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4001/small/Fantom_round.png?1669652346","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4001/large/Fantom_round.png?1669652346"}}},{"description":"#DeFi collateral integration\r\n\r\nOntology $ONT will be onboarded as collateral for Fantom Finance.
