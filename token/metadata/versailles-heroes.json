Investors can lock up VRH for 1, 2, 3, and 4 years to obtain veVRH. veVRH can be used to vote on network proposals and can also be used by investors to create a guild or join a guild for mining. To participate in the internal competition of the guild, investors can burn game token (MOH) in exchange for GAS, which can accelerate the weight of their individual mining by up to 2.5 times. In this way, a competitive environment that promotes the growth of market value is established, and investors who participate in the competition by using GAS acceleration can obtain higher returns."},"links":{"homepage":["https://versaillesheroes.com","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xead482da0793b00bbae0e34c8cfae6daf29a44b2","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xead482da0793b00bbae0e34c8cfae6daf29a44b2","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["https://www.facebook.com/VersaillesHeroes","https://www.instagram.com/versaillesheroes/","https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU7R08u_K6L3zyKmyFgVTrg"],"chat_url":["https://discord.com/invite/versaillesheroes","",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"VersHeroes","facebook_username":"VersaillesHeroes","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"VRHannouncement","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/27860/thumb/VRH___200-200.png?1667467208","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/27860/small/VRH___200-200.png?1667467208","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/27860/large/VRH___200-200.png?1667467208"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0xead482da0793b00bbae0e34c8cfae6daf29a44b2","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":0,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":100,"watchlist_portfolio_users":31,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":null,"coingecko_score":0,"developer_score":0,"community_score":0,"liquidity_score":0,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-11T04:00:42.495Z"}
