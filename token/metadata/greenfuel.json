XRP Ledger helps move “GREENFUEL” tokens around the world faster, cheaper and more sustainably than any other blockchain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarket Strategy\r\n\r\nGreenFuel chose to build on the XRP Ledger given its performance, scalability and inherently green attributes. The XRP Ledger was built with sustainability in mind and is one of the first major carbon neutral blockchains. Due to its Federated Consensus algorithm, the XRPL is significantly more energy efficient compared to proof-of-work blockchains and ensures low-cost transactions.\r\n\r\nKey focus points of the GreenFuel ecosystem include the role of climate change and climate security, the prevention and mitigation of illicit financial transactions, and on carbon emission initiatives using blockchain technology to bring transparency to carbon accounting by avoiding double counting of emission reductions or removals.\r\nXRP Ledger is the first-ever widespread decarbonization of a public blockchain, addressing a significant environmental challenge for blockchain technologies around the world.\r\nThe pioneering innovation has been achieved using technology from The Energy Web Foundation.\r\nThis initial deployment uses energy attribute certificates (EACs) from renewable energy assets to decarbonize the blockchain’s electricity use.\r\nXRP Ledger is already one of the greenest blockchains in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVision\r\nThe train has left the station’ – It has become clear and undeniable that currency and commodities that once existed only in physical form or paper representations, will for the foreseeable future exist perpetually in a tokenized digital form across Distributed Ledger Technology, verifiably authentic and controlled exclusively by the private-key holder. \r\nGREENFUEL investors  believe that while XRP is more then capable of solving all the world’s payment problems, it takes a team of highly skilled people focused together on a particular problem that generally culminates the necessary relationships responsible for breaking boundaries and forging technological advancements. By plugging into the global network of renewable energy Coin seeks not only to solve the problem of value transfer from A to B and B to A, but also A to C, C to A, or any other receiving party. It is believed that one day GREENFUEL Token could represent a significant portion of the current 2 Trillion dollar energy Market Capitalization – tokenized and distributed across the XRP Ledger (XRPL).\r\n\r\n\""},"links":{"homepage":["https://greenfuel.energy/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://xrpl.services/?issuer=rEbZTML6KCMwRMqD6hRTw6K8kqKgLRnEH1","","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["","",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"GFeuel","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"Greenfeuelxrpl","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://bithomp.com/explorer/rEbZTML6KCMwRMqD6hRTw6K8kqKgLRnEH1"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/24577/thumb/unnamed.png?1648203877","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/24577/small/unnamed.png?1648203877","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/24577/large/unnamed.png?1648203877"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"rEbZTML6KCMwRMqD6hRTw6K8kqKgLRnEH1","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":185,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":4796,"coingecko_score":3.042,"developer_score":0,"community_score":6.986,"liquidity_score":7.526,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-08T23:55:59.711Z"}
