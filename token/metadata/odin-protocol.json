ODIN is providing this exact solution for the mass adoption of web3, developing a unique data-centric blockchain ecosystem where the user data is self-refined and authenticated with the power of oracles.\r\nWith the growth of data adoption in the web3 space, the demand for operations supported by ODIN Protocol will increase drastically! Accordingly, Odin token adoption will be directly proportional to the mainstream adoption of web3 and data spaces."},"links":{"homepage":["https://www.odinprotocol.io","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://scan.odinprotocol.io/transactions","","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/cUXKyRq","",""],"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@odinprotocol",""],"twitter_screen_name":"odinprotocol","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"odinprotocol","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/OdinProtocol","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/ODIN-PROTOCOL"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/14934/thumb/ODIN_iso_black.png?1619076975","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/14934/small/ODIN_iso_black.png?1619076975","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/14934/large/ODIN_iso_black.png?1619076975"},"country_origin":"SG","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"ibc/c360ef34a86d334f625e4cbb7da3223aea97174b61f35bb3758081a8160f7d9b","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":100,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":0,"watchlist_portfolio_users":3146,"market_cap_rank":2276,"coingecko_rank":3863,"coingecko_score":6.064,"developer_score":0,"community_score":26.653,"liquidity_score":1,"public_interest_score":0.001,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-14T02:21:14.671Z"}
