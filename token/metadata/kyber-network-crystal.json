Kyber’s community is sizable and made up of a wide range of developers, in addition to other members of the blossoming DeFi industry.\r\n\r\nKyber’s fully on-chain design enables the protocol to maintain full transparency and verifiability. The platform claims to be the most used liquidity hub in the world.\r\n\r\nHow Is the Kyber Network Secured?\r\nAs an ERC-20 token, Kyber is built on top of and secured by the Ethereum blockchain. In addition, Kyber uses an extensive trust and security model that protects users from misbehaving administrators or exchanges, thanks to security measures built in both at the protocol and smart contract level.\r\n\r\nThe platform has been audited by several third-party security firms and researchers, including Chainsecurity, which have determined that the protocol is secure and hence free of vulnerabilities."},"links":{"homepage":["https://kyber.network/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202","https://bscscan.com/token/0xfe56d5892bdffc7bf58f2e84be1b2c32d21c308b","https://polygonscan.com/token/0x1c954e8fe737f99f68fa1ccda3e51ebdb291948c","https://snowtrace.io/token/0x39fc9e94caeacb435842fadedecb783589f50f5f","https://ftmscan.com/token/0x1e1085efaa63edfe74aad7c05a28eae4ef917c3f","https://scan.meter.io/address/0x1e1085efaa63edfe74aad7c05a28eae4ef917c3f","https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0xa00E3A3511aAC35cA78530c85007AFCd31753819","https://avascan.info/blockchain/c/address/0x39fc9e94caeacb435842fadedecb783589f50f5f/token","https://explorer.energi.network/token/0x8dbad759014b0aa140ecd7aed0e052b4f5c63be1"],"official_forum_url":["https://gov.kyber.org/","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/kyberswap","https://www.facebook.com/kyberswap/",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"kybernetwork","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"kybernetwork ","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kybernetwork/","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/kybernetwork/KyberWallet"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/14899/thumb/RwdVsGcw_400x400.jpg?1618923851","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/14899/small/RwdVsGcw_400x400.jpg?1618923851","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/14899/large/RwdVsGcw_400x400.jpg?1618923851"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0xdefa4e8a7bcba345f687a2f1456f5edd9ce97202","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":100,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":0,"watchlist_portfolio_users":22868,"market_cap_rank":236,"coingecko_rank":51,"coingecko_score":50.383,"developer_score":65.53,"community_score":39.101,"liquidity_score":56.874,"public_interest_score":0.004,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-13T15:08:00.320Z"}
