Kin will be the unit of account for all economic transactions within the Kin Ecosystem, and it will serve as the basis of interoperability with other digital services. In character, Kin is a pure cryptocurrency of fixed supply. It is fractionally divisible and long-term noninflationary. However, as described below, only a small portion of the Kin supply will become liquid in the near future, as most of the Kin supply is reserved for the Kin Rewards Engine. Like other cryptocurrencies, units of Kin are fungible and transferable, and they will be expected to trade on cryptocurrency exchanges.","links":{"web":"https://kin.kik.com/","blog":"","slack":"http://slack.kinfoundation.com/","github":"","twitter":"https://twitter.com/@kin_foundation","facebook":"","telegram":"","whitepaper":"https://kin.kik.com/Kin%20Whitepaper%20v1.pdf"},"softcap_currency":"","hardcap_currency":"","total_raised_currency":"USD","softcap_amount":null,"hardcap_amount":null,"total_raised":"98000000.0","quote_pre_sale_currency":"","base_pre_sale_amount":null,"quote_pre_sale_amount":null,"quote_public_sale_currency":"USD","base_public_sale_amount":1,"quote_public_sale_amount":0.0001,"accepting_currencies":"","country_origin":"CA","pre_sale_start_date":null,"pre_sale_end_date":null,"whitelist_url":"","whitelist_start_date":null,"whitelist_end_date":null,"bounty_detail_url":"","amount_for_sale":null,"kyc_required":true,"whitelist_available":null,"pre_sale_available":null,"pre_sale_ended":false},"watchlist_portfolio_users":25713,"market_cap_rank":747,"coingecko_rank":769,"coingecko_score":23.633,"developer_score":0,"community_score":33.915,"liquidity_score":17.352,"public_interest_score":0.002,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":329894,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-13T14:56:47.277Z"}
