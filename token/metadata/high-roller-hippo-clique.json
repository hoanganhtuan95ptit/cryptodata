We initially launched the project back on December 29th, 2021 and began as a community-run, grass roots organization with a focus on Casino/Arcade games. HRHC is actively providing a 75% revenue share back to our token holders on a daily basis and continue to build out new casino games on a regular basis(hopefully releasing blackjack tonight). In addition, we are currently partnered with some of the leading Solana Metaverse projects and plan to integrate our casino into their ecosystems (Suites, HeavenLand, Botborgs, Yakucorp, Metavillage, etc). We recently launched NFT-integrated staking and have developed a token as rewards ($ROLL). This token will be required to timelock NFT's for an added emissions bonus, accepted at our Casino (casino.hrhc.io), integrated into our future white-labeled and fully licensed partner platforms, and used as an incentive for Raydium's liquidity/fusion pools.","lt":"High Roller Hippo Clique is a collection of 4,321 NFT's on Solana, backed by approximately ~1.7K holders and roughly ~10K community members.
