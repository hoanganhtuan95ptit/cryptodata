In addition, Hcash will support private transactions, DAO governance, and quantum resistance.\r\n\r\nSince Hcash hopes to be a side chain for many different cryptocurrencies, including <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id=37&view=market\">privacy coins</a>, it will need to implement privacy features to mask how users are moving their funds. To address this issue, Hcash will come with two types of wallets: white and black. While the white addresses will be publicly viewable, the black addresses will remain private. In order to achieve this privacy, Hcash will implement zero-knowledge proofs. This system, as proven on Zcash’s blockchain, involves masking the identity of the sender and receiver through the use of advanced cryptography to verify transactions without sharing information about the transaction with miners. As a result, blockchains that implement zero-knowledge proofs do not include any identifiable user information.\r\n\r\nHshare offers enormous technical potential in the industrial, private network sector.
