On the expiry date, if there is a valid claim event, every CLAIM token will receive 1 DAI while NOCLAIM token will expire worthless. The converse is true if there is no valid claim event. In this case, every NOCLAIM token will receive 1 DAI while CLAIM token will expire worthless.","lt":"\r\nCover Protocol is a peer-to-peer insurance market, where the way it operates is more similar to prediction market.
