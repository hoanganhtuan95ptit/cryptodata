By doing so, the user's USDC will become available to borrowers, and the user will earn the USDC supply rate. fUSDC increases in value relative to the underlying USDC, meaning users can redeem more assets over time as interest is earned. The interest rate earned by lenders fluctuates and depends on the market's utilization (i.e. the percentage of deposited assets that have been borrowed).\r\n\r\nHistory of fUSDC\r\nIn January 2023, Flux was announced as a decentralized lending protocol that can support permissionless cryptoassets alongside permissioned tokens. The protocol was initially developed by Ondo Finance, a software development firm in DeFi, before being sold to Flux Finance.\r\n\r\nFlux is governed by the Ondo DAO, in which ONDO holders vote to upgrade its code and alter its risk parameters. In February 2023, the protocol was initialized and its supported assets and parameters were selected in a genesis vote. fUSDC was among the first assets to be selected, alongside fDAI and fOUSG.
