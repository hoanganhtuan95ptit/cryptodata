Unlike existing ledgers, such as bitcoin or ethereum, the QRL is specially designed to use a form of post-quantum secure signature for transactions called XMSS.The QRL also uses a low power proof-of-stake (POS) algorithm which again utilises iterative hash-chains and provably secure hash-based pseudo random number functions. The POS algorithm is designed to have zero reliance upon conventional signatures which are vulnerable to a sufficiently powerful QC and allows nodes to run on low power devices such as raspberry PI’s or laptops and passively earn income by staking.","links":{"web":"https://theqrl.org/presale/","blog":"","github":"https://github.com/theQRL/qrl","twitter":"https://twitter.com/qrledger","facebook":"","telegram":"","whitepaper":"https://theqrl.org/whitepaper/QRL_whitepaper.pdf"},"softcap_currency":"","hardcap_currency":"","total_raised_currency":"","softcap_amount":null,"hardcap_amount":null,"total_raised":null,"quote_pre_sale_currency":"","base_pre_sale_amount":null,"quote_pre_sale_amount":null,"quote_public_sale_currency":"","base_public_sale_amount":0,"quote_public_sale_amount":0,"accepting_currencies":"","country_origin":"","pre_sale_start_date":null,"pre_sale_end_date":null,"whitelist_url":"","whitelist_start_date":null,"whitelist_end_date":null,"bounty_detail_url":"","amount_for_sale":null,"kyc_required":true,"whitelist_available":null,"pre_sale_available":null,"pre_sale_ended":false},"watchlist_portfolio_users":2994,"market_cap_rank":1021,"coingecko_rank":270,"coingecko_score":33.728,"developer_score":64.874,"community_score":23.786,"liquidity_score":0.666,"public_interest_score":0.001,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":499690,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[{"description":"Introducing lattice-algebra: An elegant, high-performance post-quantum cryptography library\r\n\r\nQRL, in partnership with Geometry Labs, are excited to announce a new lattice-algebra library for efficient, elegant, and high performance post-quantum secure cryptography.\r\n\r\nIndex: \r\n\r\n- Sharing the Building Blocks\r\n- Mathematical Background\r\n- Designed for Cryptography Developers\r\n- Future Work\r\n- Library Contributors\r\n\r\nhttps://www.theqrl.org/blog/lattice-algebra-library/","category":"software_release","created_at":"2022-02-18T17:19:32.109Z","user":null,"user_title":"Director of Communications","pin":false,"project":{"type":"Coin","id":"quantum-resistant-ledger","name":"Quantum Resistant Ledger","symbol":"qrl","image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/700/thumb/yellow-black.512x512.png?1605577163","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/700/small/yellow-black.512x512.png?1605577163","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/700/large/yellow-black.512x512.png?1605577163"}}},{"description":"You have the ability to influence the emission rate of the network by voting on QIP-016! \r\n\r\nVoting site: https://vote.theqrl.org/\r\n\r\nDetailed voting instructions: https://www.theqrl.org/blog/guide-to-voting-on-qip-016/\r\n\r\nQIP pros/cons overview: https://www.theqrl.org/blog/qip016-reduce-emission-rate-of-the-network-prevote-synopsis/","category":"general","created_at":"2021-11-08T09:29:16.718Z","user":null,"user_title":"Director of Communications","pin":false,"project":{"type":"Coin","id":"quantum-resistant-ledger","name":"Quantum Resistant Ledger","symbol":"qrl","image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/700/thumb/yellow-black.512x512.png?1605577163","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/700/small/yellow-black.512x512.png?1605577163","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/700/large/yellow-black.512x512.png?1605577163"}}},{"description":"The QRL Show with Advisor Robby Dermody on Crypto, NFT’s, RAREPEPE’s and more\r\n\r\n- When did you first get involved in crypto?\r\n- Background on Counterparty, launch of the platform, origins stemming from Mastercoin, and being on of the very first decentralized exchanges.\r\n- What’s your take on the Evolution of NFT’s?
