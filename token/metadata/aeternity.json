It integrates decentralized oracles that connects real-world data with smart contracts without the need to layer one consensus mechanism on top of another. It also places smart contracts inside off-chain state channels. Only in disagreements do the smart contract code gets enforced on-chain.æternity has a unique governance model based on futarchy where miners vote and token holders bet to make decisions together.","links":{"web":"http://www.aeternity.com/","blog":"","slack":"https://pacific-beach-20900.herokuapp.com/","github":"https://github.com/aeternity/epoch","twitter":"https://twitter.com/aetrnty","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/aeternityproject/","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/aeternity","telegram":"https://telegram.me/aeternity","whitepaper":"http://blockchain.aeternity.com/%C3%A6ternity-blockchain-whitepaper.pdf"},"softcap_currency":"","hardcap_currency":"","total_raised_currency":"USD","softcap_amount":null,"hardcap_amount":null,"total_raised":"24426689.0","quote_pre_sale_currency":"","base_pre_sale_amount":null,"quote_pre_sale_amount":null,"quote_public_sale_currency":"USD","base_public_sale_amount":1,"quote_public_sale_amount":0.28,"accepting_currencies":"ETH, BTC","country_origin":"LI","pre_sale_start_date":null,"pre_sale_end_date":null,"whitelist_url":"","whitelist_start_date":null,"whitelist_end_date":null,"bounty_detail_url":"","amount_for_sale":null,"kyc_required":true,"whitelist_available":null,"pre_sale_available":null,"pre_sale_ended":false},"watchlist_portfolio_users":5607,"market_cap_rank":738,"coingecko_rank":131,"coingecko_score":42.702,"developer_score":77.162,"community_score":34.974,"liquidity_score":13.876,"public_interest_score":0.001,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":534975,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[{"description":"Do you have a favorite influencer, content creator, or a cause?\r\nSuperhero.com makes it easy for you to support them on various platforms like Twitter, YouTube, or event their own URL!\r\nAnd the best of all is that it is decentralized! \r\nHere’s a simple guide on how to send or receive tips with Superhero: https://bit.ly/34x6SMN","category":"general","created_at":"2020-10-06T15:52:16.574Z","user":"albenak@aeternity.com","user_title":"vlad@aeternity.com","pin":false,"project":{"type":"Coin","id":"aeternity","name":"Aeternity","symbol":"ae","image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1091/thumb/aeternity.png?1547035060","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1091/small/aeternity.png?1547035060","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1091/large/aeternity.png?1547035060"}}},{"description":"EXCITING NEWS! \r\næternity has partnered up with GamerHash and now AE token is available on their platform - for mining, paying with it, or swapping it for a wide range of items! \r\nTogether we will shape the future of blockchain, gaming, and NFTs Video game.\r\nRead all about the partnership here below: http://bit.ly/aeGamerHash","category":"general","created_at":"2020-09-25T08:15:38.684Z","user":"albenak@aeternity.com","user_title":"vlad@aeternity.com","pin":false,"project":{"type":"Coin","id":"aeternity","name":"Aeternity","symbol":"ae","image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1091/thumb/aeternity.png?1547035060","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1091/small/aeternity.png?1547035060","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1091/large/aeternity.png?1547035060"}}},{"description":"Wonder why developers like writing in Sophia?\r\n\r\nBecause hackers are having trouble misusing the blockchain and trick the smart contracts!\r\n\r\nHow you would ask?
