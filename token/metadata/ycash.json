The structure of the Ycash Development Fund upholds that promise: With 5% of the coins starting at block height 570,000 going to the Ycash Development Fund (managed by the nonprofit Ycash Foundation), 90% of the total 21 million Ycash coins will be allocated via the free market mining process.\r\n\r\nBut there are several other coins that also build upon the Zcash codebase and are also trying to address The Distribution Problem; what makes Ycash different?\r\n\r\nThe answer goes back to Ycash's shared blockchain history with Zcash.
