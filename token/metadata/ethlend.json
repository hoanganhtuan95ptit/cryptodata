Due to the elimination of middlemen, process fee for a loan does not exist on this platform. This provide convenience to any lender and borrower to create loans on their agreed terms. Decentralized lending has fixed many issues and one of the reasons why is the transparency of loan.\r\n\r\nThe Ethereum network provides a transparent ledger where all transactions are available to be inspected. Secondly, it isn’t necessary to find a trusted loan provider because all collateral which is the digital asset for loans are stored and locked in a smart contract and broadcasted on the public ethereum blockchain. It is also flexible for borrower to manage the collateral by refilling or withdrawing part of it. Borrower may make such changes when the lender is notified and aware of such movement. If the lender finds out that the action is not communicated, the lender is allowed to initiate a margin call.  \r\n\r\nThis year, Aave has made a major upgrades in its Q1 2018. They have deployed the new development for their peer-to-peer lending application named Alpha 0.3. The development process of Alpha 0.3 has started since the early of 2017. The new release also includes a completely new user interface which targets to lower the learning curve of user experience on the app. Furthermore, the new user interface has new sections to make lending process simpler such as including a ‘My Loan’ section, collectible badges and more. Other than that, the team is also in the process of developing more updates for the smart contracts. Hence, the team has decided to provide zero-fee lending with the use of LEND token as a medium of exchange, as an alternative to borrowing in Ethereum. The purpose of this is to provide a cross-blockchain lending currency which will prompt users to use LEND as the medium of exchange. \r\n"},"links":{"homepage":["https://aave.com/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x80fB784B7eD66730e8b1DBd9820aFD29931aab03","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x80fb784b7ed66730e8b1dbd9820afd29931aab03","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["https://www.instagram.com/aave.aave/","",""],"chat_url":["https://aave.com/discord","",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"AaveAave","facebook_username":"AaveCom","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2090735,"telegram_channel_identifier":"Aavesome","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Aave_Official","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/aave/aave-protocol","https://github.com/ETHLend/DAPP"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1365/thumb/ethlend.png?1547394586","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1365/small/ethlend.png?1547394586","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1365/large/ethlend.png?1547394586"},"country_origin":"EE","genesis_date":"2017-11-30","contract_address":"0x80fb784b7ed66730e8b1dbd9820afd29931aab03","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"ico_data":{"ico_start_date":"2017-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","ico_end_date":"2017-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","short_desc":"Democratizing Lending with Ethereum Network","description":"ETHLend is creating a lending market where any lender from anywhere can loan ether to any borrower without the risk of losses.
