Current lending and borrowing protocols which utilize smart contracts require active\r\ngovernance (e.g. to set rates and to update contracts) and/or rely on external price feeds (such as oracles like Chainlink). Because the pricing of collateral and parameterization of loans are left\r\nto subjective decision making through governance rather than market forces, these protocols\r\ncarry both solvency and liquidity risk. Governance and maintenance overhead create barriers to\r\nentry in the market for lending and borrowing of on-chain assets. Ajna solves these problems\r\nwith its unique design, which is defined by the following features:\r\n\r\nPermissionless pool creation: Much like the popular DeFi primitive, the “automated market\r\nmaker,” AMM, Ajna pools exist in unique pairs: quote token, provided by lenders and collateral\r\ntoken, provided by borrowers. Pools allow lenders to assess borrower demand for their quote\r\ntoken and for borrowers to assess lender demand for loans backed by their collateral. Pools are\r\ncreated permissionlessly, meaning anyone can create a pool to borrow arbitrary fungible tokens\r\nusing arbitrary fungible or non-fungible tokens as collateral. Therefore, no governance process is\r\nneeded to whitelist approved tokens.\r\n\r\nPrice specified lending: Ajna replaces external price feeds (oracles) by allowing lenders to input\r\nthe price at which they’re willing to lend. This price is the amount of quote token (i.e. the token\r\nthey are lending) they are willing to lend per unit of collateral pledged by the borrower. For\r\nexample, if a lender deposits at price 100, they are willing to lend 100 units of quote token per\r\none unit of collateral. Ajna pools separate prices into predefined buckets to reduce the\r\ncomplexity of the protocol, prices are therefore hereon referred to as “buckets”. Borrowers are\r\nthen able to borrow from the aggregated liquidity of these various buckets.","sl":"The Ajna protocol facilitates peer-to-pool secured loans without governance and without external\r\nprice feeds.
