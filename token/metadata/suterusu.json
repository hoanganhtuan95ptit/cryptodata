In other words, Suterusu protocol not only provides anonymity for the involved parties and but also transactional confidentiality.\r\n\r\nSuter Shield allows the sender of a transaction to arbitrarily select the target receiver of a confidential transaction without the need of sharing any secret with the receiver beforehand. Therefore, it is not only much more user-friendly, but it also provides a foundation to adapt to more sophisticated privacy-preserving DeFi functionalities such as DEX, insurance, loan, etc.\r\n\r\nIn addition, compared with other similar solution, Suter Shield not only facilitates the anonymous and confidential transactions of ETH and ERC-20 tokens, but it is also a much more modularized and universal privacy-protection solution for any smart-contract platforms, which is why we can easily transform our solutions to other platforms such as BSC or HECO. Furthermore, the Suter VM not only provides anonymous payment functionality for smart contract platforms but also anonymous BTC cross-chain functionality that will bring more liquidity to the Suter ecosystem.\r\n\r\nSuterusu’s vision to provide privacy-protection for the users of all digital assets, therefore, Suterusu takes regulation compliance to its heart at the beginning of the system design. We apply blacklist and recursive blacklisting to ensure our system is regulation compliant. Any Suter transfer operation is required to compare the sender accounts of a transaction to the blacklist accounts. A transaction that involves any blacklist account will be rejected. This will guarantee the Suterusu ecosystem will effectively eradicate any misbehavior that is against the financial regulation, such as money launder.\r\n\r\nSuter token is native governance and utility token.
