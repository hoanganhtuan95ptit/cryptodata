Maintained by a group of aviation professionals, Aeron wants to reduce air transport-related accidents, which it says currently numbers around 3302 per year. One of the major causes of such accidents is the lack of real experience among pilots, since unsecured flight log data from them is susceptible to fraud and forgery. Also, due to \"pay to fly\" experiences, corrupt flight schools, negligence of aircraft operators, the primary data driving any decision is affected.\r\n\r\nAeron is built upon a robust and cryptographically secure database that makes it unique compared to other online travel companies, travel search services or internal applications made for flight officials. With this technology, falsification of data can be kept at a minimum.

The way it works is simple. The pilot’s application is used for personal flight logging. The corporate application of the aviation company collects and verifies data from aviation schools, service companies, airlines, and aviation data operators. In case of an mismatch in data between any Aeron data source with either the ATC, pilot, or operator, aviation authorities can quickly see and eliminate the problem. Pilots operating under an expired license can also be monitored. As a consumer, or aviation school student, you have access to the verified global database through aerotrips.com. A simple alteration to safer air travel like blockchain can really make a difference. Air travel is for everyone, and it is beneficial for every single person to get involved in making trips safer.
