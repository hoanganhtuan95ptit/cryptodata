This architecture allows these identities, known as Accumulate Digital Identifiers (ADIs), to be processed and validated in parallel over the Accumulate network. Each ADI also possesses a hierarchical set of keys with different priority levels that allow users to manage their security over time and create complex signature authorization schemes that expand the utility of multi-signature transactions. A two token system provides predictable costs for enterprise users, while anchoring all transactions to Layer-1 blockchains provides enterprise-grade security to everyone."},"links":{"homepage":["https://accumulatenetwork.io/","https://accumulatenetwork.io/blog/","https://accumulatenetwork.io/learn/"],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xDF4Ef6EE483953fE3B84ABd08C6A060445c01170","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xdf4ef6ee483953fe3b84abd08c6a060445c01170","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["http://linkedin.com/company/accumulatenetwork","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/X74hPx8VZT","https://medium.com/@accumulate",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"accumulatehq","facebook_username":"Accumulate-106248405122449","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"accumulatenetwork","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/AccumulateNetwork"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/27207/thumb/accumulate-logo-200x200.png?1662607409","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/27207/small/accumulate-logo-200x200.png?1662607409","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/27207/large/accumulate-logo-200x200.png?1662607409"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0xdf4ef6ee483953fe3b84abd08c6a060445c01170","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":117,"market_cap_rank":1239,"coingecko_rank":5248,"coingecko_score":2.253,"developer_score":0,"community_score":10.241,"liquidity_score":0,"public_interest_score":0.001,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-11T05:40:20.601Z"}
