거대한 점보트론 광고가 타임 스퀘어 (Times Square)에서 빛을 발할 수있었습니다. 그들의 ICO 토큰 판매의 처음 5 일 동안, EOS는 전례가없는 1 억 8500 만 달러의 ETH를 올렸습니다 - 모든 종류의 제품이나 서비스가 아직 없었습니다.\r\n\r\nEOS는 \"분산 애플리케이션을위한 가장 강력한 인프라\"라고 주장합니다. 기본적으로 EOS는 Ethereum과 같은 블록 체인 기술입니다 (또는 오히려). 그들은 긴 인상적인 기능을 가진 블록 체인을 만들 계획입니다. 어떤 사람들은 심지어 EOS를 \"Ethereum killer\"라고 부릅니다. 그러나 EOS에 대한 과장된 흥분과 함께 암호 공동체로부터 많은 회의론이 있습니다.\r\n\r\nEOS 비전\r\nEOS는 큰 계획을 가지고 있습니다. 그것은 분산 운영 체제로 작동 할 소프트웨어입니다. 개발자는 EOS 소프트웨어에서 응용 프로그램을 작성할 수 있습니다. 확장 성이 뛰어나고 유연하며 유용 할 것입니다. 모든 사람이 가장 주목할만한 기능은 수평 확장 성입니다. 즉, EOS 블록 체인은 스마트 계약을 병렬로 실행하고 트랜잭션을 동시에 처리 할 수있게됩니다. 이것은 게임 체인저가 될 수 있습니다.\r\n\r\nEOS는 창립자 인 Dan Larimer 자신이 만든 위임 된 증거 ​​증명 (DPoS) 합의 프로토콜을 통합합니다. 이 시스템은 중앙 집중화가 적고 에너지 사용량이 훨씬 적으며 초당 수백만 트랜잭션까지 빨라집니다. 또한 EOS 블록 체인에 대한 사용자 요금이 부과되지 않습니다. 이것은 또한 경쟁사와 차별화 될 것이며 플랫폼 플랫폼의 보급 확대를 도울 수 있습니다.\r\n\r\nEOS는 또한 사용자 권리를 확보하고 분쟁 해결을 가능하게하기 위해 블록 체인 구성을 시행하기를 원합니다. \"EOS.IO 소프트웨어는 검증 된 개념 및 모범 사례를 사용한 경험을 바탕으로 설계되었으며 블록 체인 기술의 근본적인 진보를 나타냅니다.이 소프트웨어는 분산 형 응용 프로그램이있는 세계적으로
