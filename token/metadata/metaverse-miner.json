Humans named the virtual universe “Metaverse”. \r\n\r\nThe operation of “Metaverse” requires powerful computing power and energy, and the computing power of “droplets” has gradually reached its limit, which requires the construction of more energy supplies. To this end, the “Metaverse” Management Alliance started a project code-named “Metaverse Miner”. It aims to encourage adventurous explorers to explore a wider range of galaxies, use terminal control machines to obtain various primal energies in unfamiliar galaxies, and link “Metaverse” to every human planet through the interstellar logistics network."},"links":{"homepage":["http://www.meta.auto/","https://meta.auto/gitbook/en/",""],"blockchain_site":["https://bscscan.com/token/0x04073D16C6a08C27e8BbEbe262Ea4D1C6fa4C772","","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.com/invite/NmjZTjfD3a","",""],"announcement_url":["https://metaverseminer.medium.com/",""],"twitter_screen_name":"MetaverseMiner","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"MetaverseMiner","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/18408/thumb/d360aee2b1bd9fd9.png?1631795640","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/18408/small/d360aee2b1bd9fd9.png?1631795640","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/18408/large/d360aee2b1bd9fd9.png?1631795640"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0x04073d16c6a08c27e8bbebe262ea4d1c6fa4c772","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":4041,"market_cap_rank":3446,"coingecko_rank":3285,"coingecko_score":9.527,"developer_score":0,"community_score":8.375,"liquidity_score":1,"public_interest_score":0.001,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-14T00:55:45.387Z"}
