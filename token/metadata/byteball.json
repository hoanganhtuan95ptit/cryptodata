DAG는 이런 시스템에서 바이트는 거래에 대한 수수료를 지급하는 데에 쓰입니다. \r\n\r\n따라서 바이트볼은 채굴이 아닌 배포 방식으로 발행되고 있으며, 따라서 코인의 발행을 위한 추가비용이 발생하지 않습니다. 매달 보름달이 뜰 때마다 공짜로 코인을 받을 수 있으나, 기여도에 따라 배포 받는 코인의 수가 달라집니다. 소유하고 있는 비트코인과 바이트볼의 양이 그 기여도의 지표가 되며, 비트코인 지갑을 바이트볼 지갑과 연결함으로써 가진 자산의 크기를 인증하면 바이트볼을 받을 수 있습니다.\r\n\r\n코인 특징\r\n1. 바이트볼은 P2P 채팅 시스템에 기초해 운영되며, 메신저 플랫폼이라고 볼 수 있습니다. 위챗이나 카카오톡으로 택시나 피자를 주문할 수 있는 것처럼 바이트볼은 챗봇(chatbot)과 결합하여 다양한 서비스를 제공합니다. \r\n\r\n2. 바이트볼 코인의 최종 배포가 완료되면 추가적인 코인 발행은 없습니다. 이렇게 무료로 사람들에게 코인을 배포하는 이유는 무료마케팅, 거래유도, 지속적인 투자유도를 위해서입니다. 또한, 지급된 수수료는 환원되기 때문에 유통되는 화폐량은 동일하게 유지됩니다. \r\n\r\n3. 바이트볼은 스마트 컨트랙트랑 비슷한 조건부 지급(Conditional payment)이라는 시스템을 운영합니다. 조건이 이행되지 않으면 지불했던 금액을 다시 되받을 수 있는 구조로 되어 있습니다. 이 외에도 P2P 보험, 예측시장, P2P 베팅, 다중서명 등의 다양한 기능을 지원합니다. \r\n\r\n4. 블랙바이트는 바이트볼의 다크버전으로, 바이트볼보다 익명성이 강화된 코인입니다. 블랙바이트는 공공장부에서는 보이지 않고 P2P로 거래되기 때문에 모네로나 대시보다 더 강화된 익명성을 구현합니다. \r\n\r\n핵심 가치\r\n(키워드: DAG)\r\n\r\n바이트볼은 블록체인 기술을 사용하지 않고, DAG를 사용해 거래들을 기록합니다. 이전 거래의 해시들을 새로운 거래에 사인함으로써 거래들이 연결되기 때문에, 블록이 필요 없고, 블록 크기의 문제도 존재하지 않습니다. 이런 기술은 양자 컴퓨터에 대비해 만들어진 새로운 검증 방식으로써, 미래에 양자 컴퓨터가 구현되어도 안전하다고 합니다. 또한, 한 방향으로 이어지는 블록체인과는 다르게, 거래기록들이 상호 작용하며 시스템이 운영된다는 차이가 있습니다.
