The game features Free-to-Play, Create-to-Earn and a new way to earn which we believe will become the next trend in NFT gaming: Compete-to-Earn. Additionally, we have multiple game modes, including PvE with Rogue-like and PvP, Seasonal Ranking system, Tournament, Items staking and even more will come in the future. The hero will be our NFT. There are 3 attributes defined the Hero: Races, Classes, Skills. Race and Class attributes are hero-based. When unlocked, Heroes will include 1 empty skill slot. The player needs to add a skill card. When opening upper level, the heroes will unlock additional skill slots, most will max out at 6 slots. Aside from that Skill Cards, Gold and Items also are NFTs"},"links":{"homepage":["https://himo.world/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://www.bscscan.com/token/0x469aCf8e1F29C1B5Db99394582464Fad45A1fC6F","https://bscscan.com/token/0x469aCf8e1F29C1B5Db99394582464Fad45A1fC6F","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.com/invite/himoworld","",""],"announcement_url":["https://himoworld.medium.com/",""],"twitter_screen_name":"himoworldglobal","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"HimoWorldOfficial","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/23000/thumb/16726.png?1643090812","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/23000/small/16726.png?1643090812","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/23000/large/16726.png?1643090812"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0x469acf8e1f29c1b5db99394582464fad45a1fc6f","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":1134,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":5157,"coingecko_score":2.315,"developer_score":0,"community_score":9.615,"liquidity_score":1,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-13T13:30:07.174Z"}
