By leveraging the power of memes, PLUMS will create a network that is not only fun and entertaining, but also has the potential for real-world impact.\r\n\r\nWhat makes PLUMS unique?\r\nOne of the things that makes PLUMS stand out from other meme coins is that itâ€™s supply will not be centralised to individual wallets and its launch involved a $PLUMS airdrop to those who contributed to the initial LP before it reached a hard cap of 20ETH. Moreover, PLUMS has adopted PEPEâ€™s no-tax policy. This means that holders of the currency do not have to pay any taxes on their earnings, which can be a significant benefit for those who are looking to invest in a cryptocurrency that has the potential for high returns. The tokens fun and playful nature makes it appealing to those who are not necessarily interested in the more serious aspects of traditional cryptocurrencies. \r\n\r\nRelated Links:\r\n\r\nTelegram: https://t.me/+efZpJvv7Y9thODhhâ€¦\r\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Xkk545eC\r\nWebsite: https://plums.wtf/\r\n","sl":"One-liner description: \r\n$PLUMS, for the people, by the people ðŸ’Žâœ‹\r\n\r\nWhat is PLUMS?\r\nPLUMS is aÂ memecoinÂ launched by the people, for the people.
