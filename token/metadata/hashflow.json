This means Hashflow can offer seamless trading of products (i.e. options, ETFs) that were previously impossible in DeFi.\r\n\r\nHFT's utility:\r\n- HFT is the native token for the Hashflow protocol as well as the Hashverse, Hashflow’s gamified DAO and governance platform.\r\n- Governance: Hashflow governance will follow a vote-escrow (ve) token model where voting rights are determined based on the amount of HFT staked as well as the duration for which HFT is locked. Staking tokens will grant users the right to vote and manage the future of the protocol. This includes decisions relating to protocol fees, marketing, and code development.\r\n- In-DAO Health & Rewards: The Hashverse is the first-ever storyverse-driven, gamified DAO and governance platform. Staked tokens will be used to determine users’ health metrics within the Hashverse. The protocol will continue to reward the most active members of the community and their Hashverse presence will play a major role in redeeming these rewards.","sl":"Hashflow is a decentralized exchange designed for interoperability, zero slippage, and MEV-protected trades.
