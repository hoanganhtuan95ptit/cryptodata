The Best Part is - You can apply for the Okse card from more than 172 countries. \r\n‘But how long will it take to reach me?’ Well that is another great thing about the Okse card; There is no need to wait until the physical card arrives because after your KYC is approved, you can create your virtual card right away. You can add it to Apple pay or Google pay and start shopping contactless. \r\n\r\nThe Okse card is not just a debit or prepaid card, it allows you to store your crypto decentralized without counterpart risk until you spend it with your card and every transaction is documented on-chain . ‘Your crypto is your crypto.’ \r\nOkse is based on the BNB Chain and several other networks. So you can use your Coins or Tokens directly on the specific chain where you are holding your tokens without bridging and in case you need or want to bridge your token between different chains, Okse has already partnered with the Celer Network. \r\n\r\nOkse has its own utility token called OKSE and in the near future it will be available to trade, spend, as a discount option and as a valuable asset to increase your daily spending/top-up limit for your Okse card. \r\n\r\nThe basic daily spending limit or top up limit is $250 and the maximum is $10,000 daily, which can be increased as well based on special requests and additional due diligence. \r\nTo provide such a service the Okse Team created a subscription model with a payment of $6.99 monthly per user; and if you pay with the Okse token, you also get a 10% discount every month. \r\n\r\nWith the Okse card you can spend and top up tokens like, BNB, BUSD, USDT, AVAX, USDC , FTM and several others.
