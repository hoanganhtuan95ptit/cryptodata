The special NFTs that will be dropped as rewards each season will be the voting rights for this in-game DAO, allowing players to make their own voices heard in the development of the game. \r\n\r\n◆ What can your token be used for?\r\n\r\nThe Forbidden Fruit Energy Token is the energy unit in the game. It  limits the number of times a player can engage in the games available within the BountyKinds universe. \r\n$FFE is also available for purchase. Purchased $FFE tokens can be used to play without having to wait for FFE to recover.\r\n"},"links":{"homepage":["https://bountykinds.com/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://bscscan.com/token/0x9E0335fb61958Fe19Bb120F3F8408B4297921820","","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","https://www.instagram.com/bountykinds",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/bountykinds","",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"bountykinds","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"bountykinds","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/30453/thumb/FFE_TOKEN.png?1684491407","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/30453/small/FFE_TOKEN.png?1684491407","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/30453/large/FFE_TOKEN.png?1684491407"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0x9e0335fb61958fe19bb120f3f8408b4297921820","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":20,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":null,"coingecko_score":0,"developer_score":0,"community_score":0,"liquidity_score":0,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-13T13:12:58.626Z"}
