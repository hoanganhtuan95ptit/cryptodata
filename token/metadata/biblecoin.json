By the use of blockchain technology, Bible Coin (BIBL) introduces custom solutions to overcome such matters.\r\n\r\nBlockchain technology demonstrates the improvements to the current system – especially how cryptocurrency transfers enable instant and traceable donations to the church and its missionary activities.\r\n\r\nBible Coin’s native cryptocurrency BIBL is a BEP-20 token with a total supply of 10,000,000,000 BIBL. However, only 50% of that total supply will be available for circulation, with the rest set aside as staking rewards for the future. BIBL will facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions and donations, as well as provide staking rewards and enable remote elections.\r\n"},"links":{"homepage":["https://bibl-coin.com/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://bscscan.com/","https://bscscan.com/token/0xdd041e030ade3db3b2221ce681b65f9650f250d7","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["https://www.linkedin.com/company/biblcoin/","",""],"chat_url":["","",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"biblcoin","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"biblcoin","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/26406/thumb/tLvtI1NT_400x400.jpeg?1657924146","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/26406/small/tLvtI1NT_400x400.jpeg?1657924146","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/26406/large/tLvtI1NT_400x400.jpeg?1657924146"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0xdd041e030ade3db3b2221ce681b65f9650f250d7","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":41,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":3761,"coingecko_score":6.458,"developer_score":0,"community_score":8.337,"liquidity_score":23.119,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-12T07:20:55.286Z"}
