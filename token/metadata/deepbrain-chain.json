The DeepBrain Chain token is traded via smart contract based on NEO, and our token is called DeepBrain Coin (DBC), and the mining node is encouraged according to the incentive system designed by the smart contract. The DeepBrain Chain is a decentralized neural network. The calculating demands of enterprises will be distributed to countless mining nodes all over the world. It will get DBC as a return when the nodes deployed computational mirror image successfully and the GAS fee each enterprise need to pay is far less than the intrinsic fee.  The DeepBrain Chain is also a secure data trading platform. Both of the trading parties don’t need to worry about data leakage or reselling. Blockchain technology is used to realize the separation of data ownership and usage rights drastically. Thus, the value of data will be promoted greatly.","links":{"web":"https://www.deepbrainchain.org/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/DeepBrainChain","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/Deepbrain-Chain-1471922089587549/","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/deepbrain-chain/","telegram":"https://t.me/deepbrainchain","whitepaper":"https://www.deepbrainchain.org/pc/DeepBrainChainWhitepaper.pdf","bitcointalk":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2509823.0"},"softcap_currency":"","hardcap_currency":"","total_raised_currency":"","softcap_amount":null,"hardcap_amount":null,"total_raised":null,"quote_pre_sale_currency":"","base_pre_sale_amount":null,"quote_pre_sale_amount":null,"quote_public_sale_currency":"","base_public_sale_amount":0,"quote_public_sale_amount":0,"accepting_currencies":"","country_origin":"","pre_sale_start_date":null,"pre_sale_end_date":null,"whitelist_url":"","whitelist_start_date":null,"whitelist_end_date":null,"bounty_detail_url":"","amount_for_sale":null,"kyc_required":true,"whitelist_available":null,"pre_sale_available":null,"pre_sale_ended":false},"watchlist_portfolio_users":11438,"market_cap_rank":1095,"coingecko_rank":1796,"coingecko_score":16.002,"developer_score":0,"community_score":9.191,"liquidity_score":14.612,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":1368571,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-12T11:22:19.315Z"}
