People with large capital who do not want to take great risks can become one of their liquidity providers. Conversely, users who enter the market with low capital can exit with a solid profit.\r\nThe Marnotaur team is building a user-friendly platform with pretty unique features inside - gas & capital efficiency, distribution of liquidation fees, permissionless pools and of course, there is under-collateralized marginal trading.\r\nMarnotaur also offers its users up to 10x leverage, acting not just as an instrument for opening short and long positions but as a loan for farming as well."},"links":{"homepage":["https://marnotaur.com/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://bscscan.com/token/0x19b99162adaab85134e781ac0048c275c31b205a","","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://space.bilibili.com/1646726586","https://discord.com/invite/VqYGFWYhAa",""],"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/marnotaur",""],"twitter_screen_name":"marnotaur","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"marnotaur","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/18655/thumb/taur.PNG?1632795749","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/18655/small/taur.PNG?1632795749","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/18655/large/taur.PNG?1632795749"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0x19b99162adaab85134e781ac0048c275c31b205a","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":508,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":5306,"coingecko_score":2.226,"developer_score":0,"community_score":9.207,"liquidity_score":1,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-14T00:29:58.323Z"}
