GameFi, the fusion of gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi), has gained immense popularity by offering users the ability to earn rewards and create value through gaming activities. Additionally, Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) have provided users with the flexibility to trade staked assets and access liquidity while participating in proof-of-stake blockchain networks.
