Instead, the solution uses Web Cryptography API and blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nWith the Protocol being built on EOSIO codebase, REMChain is an independent blockchain fueled by the REM token. REM is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum with the permanent possibility to swap it to REMChain native tokens in both directions.\""},"links":{"homepage":["https://remme.io/","https://directory.remme.io/",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x83984d6142934bb535793a82adb0a46ef0f66b6d","https://testchain.remme.io/","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x83984d6142934bb535793a82adb0a46ef0f66b6d","","https://remchain.remme.io/","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["","",""],"announcement_url":["https://remme.io/category/pki-d-protocol",""],"twitter_screen_name":"remme_io","facebook_username":"remme.io","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"remme","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/remme/","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/Remmeauth/remprotocol"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2152/thumb/semme.png?1561622861","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2152/small/semme.png?1561622861","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2152/large/semme.png?1561622861"},"country_origin":"VG","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0x83984d6142934bb535793a82adb0a46ef0f66b6d","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"ico_data":{"ico_start_date":"2017-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","ico_end_date":"2017-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","short_desc":"Passwordless authentication for humans and devices","description":"65% of confirmed data breaches involve weak, default, or stolen passwords and cybercrime costs the global economy around $400 billion annually.
