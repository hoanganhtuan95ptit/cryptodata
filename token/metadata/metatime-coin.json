MetaChain is designed to provide blockchain solutions such as ZK, Subnet, and Privacy Chain to third-party applications. All of MetaChain's decentralized products are developed by Metatime with a \"Human-Centered\" philosophy.\"\r\n\r\nWhat Makes MetaChain (Metatime Coin) Unique?\r\n\r\nMetaChain is unique due to several features. Firstly, it has its own EVM-like virtual machine called the Meta Virtual Machine which enables instant communication between nodes. It also has a high capacity to verify transactions, with a check rate of 700,000+ transactions per second in almost zero time. Additionally, MetaChain allows for mining with powerful hardware, computers, and even mobile devices, creating a more distributed structure. The platform also offers an easy way to create smart contracts through interfaces, allowing creators to quickly and safely create their projects.","sk":"Meta Chain is a blockchain service ecosystem that aims to solve the blockchain triad through Meta Anthil scaling.
