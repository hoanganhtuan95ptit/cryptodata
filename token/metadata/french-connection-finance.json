We empower cryptocurrency holders by allowing them to purchase goods and services through our fully-encrypted cryptocurrency payment gateway. Merchants can accept payment in a wide range of cryptocurrencies, via a fiat to crypto credit/debit card on-ramp or even bank transfer. They can also convert it simply and easily to fiat. This is all made simple by our easy-to-use dashboard.\r\n\r\n$FCF is our Revenue Sharing Token (RST). All $FCF RST holders get rewarded with fully automated dividends, paid in BNB every 24 hours. These dividends come from a share of the $FCF RST token transaction tax, as well as a share of every transaction fee from FCF Pay, allowing holders to earn passive income while benefiting from the rising price of $FCF RST.
