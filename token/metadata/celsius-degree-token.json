Members will be able to borrow USD against their crypto holdings in their wallet which will be used as collateral. Our goal is to allow anyone who’s in need of cash to easily borrow from the Celsius platform without having to sell their crypto holdings. In the future, through the Celsius Network, cryptocurrencies deposited by members into their Celsius Wallet will be available on the network for immediate borrowing and shorting.\r\n\r\n"},"links":{"homepage":["https://celsius.network/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xaaaebe6fe48e54f431b0c390cfaf0b017d09d42d","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xaaaebe6fe48e54f431b0c390cfaf0b017d09d42d","https://polygonscan.com/token/0xd85d1e945766fea5eda9103f918bd915fbca63e6","https://ftmscan.com/token/0x2c78f1b70ccf63cdee49f9233e9faa99d43aa07e","https://scan.meter.io/address/0x2c78f1b70ccf63cdee49f9233e9faa99d43aa07e","https://ftmscan.com/address/0x2c78f1b70ccf63cdee49f9233e9faa99d43aa07e","https://explorer.energi.network/token/0x1b53c0662414b195fcd5802c09754765b930a312","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["","",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"celsiusnetwork","facebook_username":"CelsiusNetwork","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2517756,"telegram_channel_identifier":"","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CelsiusNetwork","repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3263/thumb/CEL_logo.png?1609598753","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3263/small/CEL_logo.png?1609598753","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3263/large/CEL_logo.png?1609598753"},"country_origin":"US","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0xaaaebe6fe48e54f431b0c390cfaf0b017d09d42d","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":75,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":25,"ico_data":{"ico_start_date":"2018-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","ico_end_date":"2018-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","short_desc":"P2P Decentralized Lending & Borrowing Platform","description":null,"links":{},"softcap_currency":"USD","hardcap_currency":"USD","total_raised_currency":"USD","softcap_amount":"15000000.0","hardcap_amount":"50000000.0","total_raised":"50000000.0","quote_pre_sale_currency":"USD","base_pre_sale_amount":"1.0","quote_pre_sale_amount":"0.2","quote_public_sale_currency":"USD","base_public_sale_amount":1,"quote_public_sale_amount":0.3,"accepting_currencies":"ETH,BTC,USD","country_origin":"US","pre_sale_start_date":"2017-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","pre_sale_end_date":"2018-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","whitelist_url":"https://crowdsale.celsius.network/users/sign_up","whitelist_start_date":null,"whitelist_end_date":null,"bounty_detail_url":"","amount_for_sale":"325000000.0","kyc_required":true,"whitelist_available":null,"pre_sale_available":null,"pre_sale_ended":false},"watchlist_portfolio_users":46232,"market_cap_rank":342,"coingecko_rank":249,"coingecko_score":34.898,"developer_score":0,"community_score":43.208,"liquidity_score":50.44,"public_interest_score":0.017,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":36101,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-12T13:43:56.065Z"}
