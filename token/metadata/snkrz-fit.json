Since starting the project in March 2022, SNKRZ has built a community of over 160,000 and is already one of the top NFT projects in the Klaytn network.\r\n\r\nWhat makes your project unique?\r\nUnlike most Web3 move-to-earn projects, SNKRZ aims to reach a mass audience, primarily a Web2 audience focusing more on the “move” than the “earn” and transferring most of the value created from Web2 to Web3, rather than relying on an unsustainable circular pyramidal model current engage-to-earn apps use. To achieve this, SNKRZ is building a LAND metaverse where users can also own a piece of Land (as an NFT) that is mapped to a real-world map. LAND owners will be able to monetize Web3 and Web2 users’ online and offline traffic, which will be valuable to brands and corporations, as well as hold events and quests.\r\n\r\nHistory of your project.\r\nSNKRZ is the Move & Earn project started its closed beta in May 2022 and officially launched in September 2022. It is the world's first Move & Earn project that combines Move & Earn and Land-fi, introducing SNKRZ Land3 to create a harmonious ecosystem.\r\n\r\nWhat can your token be used for?\r\nThe $FIT token can be used to purchase land in the Land3 project and to acquire gems for equipping on land or SNKRZ sneakers. It can also be utilized by users in the SNKRZ project to purchase various items that are useful to them.\r\n"},"links":{"homepage":["https://www.thesnkrz.com/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x9B01637302B6Adfc2C82678e2A8D680CFF6337B7","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x9b01637302b6adfc2c82678e2a8d680cff6337b7","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.com/invite/thesnkrz","https://medium.com/@thesnkrz","https://www.youtube.com/@thesnkrz"],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"theSNKRZ","facebook_username":null,"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/30918/thumb/FIT_Token_1000.png?1688956436","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/30918/small/FIT_Token_1000.png?1688956436","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/30918/large/FIT_Token_1000.png?1688956436"},"country_origin":null,"genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0x9b01637302b6adfc2c82678e2a8d680cff6337b7","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":100,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":0,"watchlist_portfolio_users":21,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":null,"coingecko_score":0,"developer_score":0,"community_score":0,"liquidity_score":0,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-11T02:27:30.321Z"}
