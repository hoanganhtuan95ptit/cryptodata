DBFT는 보다 안전한 블록체인 플랫폼을 구현하기 위해, 노드를 운영하는 북키퍼(bookkeeper)와 블록체인 사용자로 네트워크 참가자를 분리합니다. 전문화된 북키퍼들은 사용자들에 의해 선출되고, 검증마다 이들 중 랜덤으로 블록 생성자가 결정됩니다. 그리고 만약 2/3의 북키퍼들이 검증에 동의하면 컨센서스가 체결됩니다. 이렇게 블록체인 사용 주체를 오롯이 분리해 접근하는 것은 기존 컨센서스 메커니즘에 없던 독특한 방식입니다. \r\n\r\n2. 네오 플랫폼은 네오와 네오가스라는 두 가지의 토큰을 가지고 있습니다. 이더리움과 마찬가지로, 네오가스는 플랫폼에 대한 이용료를 지급하는 데에 쓰이며 지급된 가스는 네트워크를 관리하는 북키퍼들에게 경제적 인센티브로 돌아갑니다.\r\n\r\n3. 양자 컴퓨터는 블록체인 시스템을 무력화시킬 수 있다는 우려가 있습니다. 이에 네오는 NeoQS(QuantumSafe)라는 격자구조의 암호구조를 통해 양자 컴퓨터에 대응할 수 있는 알고리즘을 갖추고 있다고 합니다. \r\n\r\n4. NeoX는 크로스 체인 상호 운영을 지원하는 프로토콜로, 이를 통해 atomic asset swap을 달성할 수 있습니다. 또한, 다른 체인에서 실행되는 스마트 컨트랙트의 일관성을 유지할 수 있습니다. \r\n\r\n핵심 가치\r\n(키워드: 중국시장, 대중적인 컴퓨터 언어 지원)\r\n\r\n1. 중국시장: 14억 인구의 시장인 중국에서 시작된 첫 블록체인 기술이기에 중국 시장에서의 선전을 기대할 수 있습니다. 또한, 중국인들이 서양의 소프트웨어보다 알리바바, 바이두, 텐센트(QQ)와 같은 자신들의 것을 비교적 선호한다는 점에서 잠재력이 큽니다. \r\n\r\n2. 대중적인 컴퓨터 언어 지원: 네오는 C#, Java, Go과 같은 다양한 언어를 지원하고 있고, 앞으로 C, C ++, Python, JavaScript까지 확장할 예정이라고 합니다.
