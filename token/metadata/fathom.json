We then launched on a dex that was not tracked by CG or CMC so we have launched V2 in order to correct a contract mistake and allow us to list on PCS. Then sniperbots hit our launch due to the price increase from V1. We are now stabilizing and building our revenue streams daily. \r\n\r\nWhat’s next for your project?\r\nWe will be building the external revenue further with our collected funds. \r\n\r\nWhat can your token be used for?\r\nOur token is primarily used to stake and allow for an ROI on the token. This acts like a part ownership in the external revenue. \r\n","he":"What is the project about?\r\nOur project is about creating a stable ROI with external revenue streams using trading bots.
