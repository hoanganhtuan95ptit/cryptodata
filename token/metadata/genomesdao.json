Genomes.io brokers the queries and it is up to individuals whether they want to approve this query. GENE is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain.\r\n\r\nData buyers eg. Pharmaceutical companies and Research organisations will be able to set the price that they offer folks for each query. This will be translated into GENE tokens for costeffectiveness. This is why the tokens have value."},"links":{"homepage":["https://genomes.io/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x21413c119b0c11c5d96ae1bd328917bc5c8ed67e","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x21413c119b0c11c5d96ae1bd328917bc5c8ed67e","https://polygonscan.com/token/0x34667ED7C36cBBbF2d5d5c5c8d6Eb76a094EDb9F","https://arbiscan.io/token/0x59a729658e9245b0cf1f8cb9fb37945d2b06ea27","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://www.facebook.com/genomesio","https://discord.com/invite/genomes",""],"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@intern_57220",""],"twitter_screen_name":"genomesdao","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/20807/thumb/1637683704200x200.png?1637708934","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/20807/small/1637683704200x200.png?1637708934","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/20807/large/1637683704200x200.png?1637708934"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0x21413c119b0c11c5d96ae1bd328917bc5c8ed67e","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":66.67,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":33.33,"watchlist_portfolio_users":1957,"market_cap_rank":1867,"coingecko_rank":3226,"coingecko_score":9.887,"developer_score":0,"community_score":7.635,"liquidity_score":1,"public_interest_score":0.001,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-13T13:32:52.105Z"}
