Ethereum transactions can contain all kinds of different things but the one thing that always gets forgotten is the fact that you can send a permanent & transparent message on-chain. The issue that we saw was that it wasn't easy for the average user. So what did we do about it?

Overall we have been working on EMS for a fair few months now and have no plans to halt any of the development.\r\n\r\nWhat’s next for your project?\r\nWith V.1.0 of our dApp already out and free-to-use for all, the obvious next step is improving. Our motto is onwards & upwards (that might or might not be from movie haha). We are hoping to add whatever the communities heart desires (within reason) but the next update will feature a library of ascii art for them to choose from when sending a message.\r\n\r\nWhat can your token be used for?\r\nThe EMS token—the governance token of the Ethereum Message Service—allows those who hold it to vote on changes to the Ethereum Message Service dApp. Note that anyone, not only EMS holders, can submit proposals for an EMS vote."},"links":{"homepage":["https://emservice.gg/","https://app.emservice.gg/",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x247dc9cbbaadabce6e30e2a84ec6c53a419913ad","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x247dc9cbbaadabce6e30e2a84ec6c53a419913ad","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["","https://medium.com/@EthereumMessageService",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"EthMsgService","facebook_username":null,"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"EthereumMessagePortal","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/29812/thumb/LogoEMS200x200.png?1681432251","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/29812/small/LogoEMS200x200.png?1681432251","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/29812/large/LogoEMS200x200.png?1681432251"},"country_origin":null,"genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0x247dc9cbbaadabce6e30e2a84ec6c53a419913ad","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":94,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":null,"coingecko_score":0,"developer_score":0,"community_score":0,"liquidity_score":0,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-06-22T19:30:05.596Z"}
