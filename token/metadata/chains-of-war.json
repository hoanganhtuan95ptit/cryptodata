The game we’re designing aims to have all of this, with the working title ‘Chains of War: Escape from Tyrrha’: Drop into the world of Tyrrha, survive and escape.\r\n\r\nThe Chains of War game will be available for anyone to play. Therefore, during the gamification phase a new collection of Heroes will be released. In this collection everyone can make a Hero by using the NFT forge. The NFT forge also makes it possible to customize your hero with gear or weapons that you earn while playing the game.\r\n\r\nIn a time of increasing digital experiences, Chains of War offers opportunities to add value to the conventional gaming industry."},"links":{"homepage":["https://www.chainsofwar.io/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://cardanoscan.io/token/160a880d9fc45380737cb7e57ff859763230aab28b3ef6a84007bfcc4d495241","","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["https://www.youtube.com/ChainsofWar","https://www.instagram.com/chainsofwar/",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.com/invite/chainsofwar","https://medium.com/@chainofwar.nft",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"ChainsofWarNFT","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/29094/thumb/Mira-Token-v2-500px.png?1676531172","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/29094/small/Mira-Token-v2-500px.png?1676531172","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/29094/large/Mira-Token-v2-500px.png?1676531172"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"160a880d9fc45380737cb7e57ff859763230aab28b3ef6a84007bfcc4d495241","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":133,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":null,"coingecko_score":0,"developer_score":0,"community_score":0,"liquidity_score":0,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-12T13:41:43.404Z"}
