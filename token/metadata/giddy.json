With the EIP we’re developing, the Giddy token standard will allow smart contracts to communicate with compliant tokens in a way that encodes contract approval data into a meta-transaction, which removes the need for standalone, infinite contract approval, and also remediates the smart contract race condition described in SWC-114 (https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-114)\r\nGiddy is also developing a non-custodial wallet that will provide multi-identity decentralized private security, direct fiat on and off-ramps, and one-tap smart contract staking.
