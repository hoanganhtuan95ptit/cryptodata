With its transparency, efficiency, low barriers to entry, and decentralized traits, the Blockchain can smoothly deliver all these assets to anyone with access to the Internet.\r\n\r\nThe INDY governance token comes from its use in the Indigo DAO voting process. The total supply of INDY will be 35M tokens with a 6-decimal precision. The max supply of INDY will be distributed to protocol users, stakers, and LPs over the course of four years. We believe in a fair distribution of the INDY tokens to the early adopters of the protocol, therefore there will be NO community pre-sale via ICO/ISO/ISPO.\r\n\r\nWhat is the Indigo DAO?\r\nIndigo is a decentralized community-led project. The Indigo DAO owns the Indigo Protocol, including the application, website, and all intellectual property. A DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) is like a company, but instead of being incorporated in a country is established in a blockchain.\r\n\r\nYou, the Indigo community, control the decisions for the Indigo DAO. You can cast your votes using the INDY token. A forum has been established to help facilitate community votes. All Indigo community members are encouraged to join the forum to propose, discuss and vote on ideas to guide Indigo’s future direction."},"links":{"homepage":["https://indigoprotocol.io/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://cardanoscan.io/tokenPolicy/533bb94a8850ee3ccbe483106489399112b74c905342cb1792a797a0","","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/gVqDRNg7VH","https://indigoprotocol1.medium.com/",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"Indigo_protocol","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"indigo_protocol","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/28303/thumb/IndigoTokenCMC.png?1669276404","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/28303/small/IndigoTokenCMC.png?1669276404","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/28303/large/IndigoTokenCMC.png?1669276404"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0x3ee2200efb3400fabb9aacf31297cbdd1d435d47","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":100,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":0,"watchlist_portfolio_users":1161,"market_cap_rank":693,"coingecko_rank":null,"coingecko_score":0,"developer_score":0,"community_score":0,"liquidity_score":0,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-13T14:29:27.094Z"}
