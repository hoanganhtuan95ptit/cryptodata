It gives them the opportunity to put their stack at work. They can use their collected fees (in ATF) to pay their day-to-day expenses as a company. It prevents them from selling their own token to do so.\r\n\r\n- For very risky pairs, if one asset value goes to 0, the LPs will lose all their stake in the pair. Thanks to Antfarm's fee system in ATF, even if one of the assets goes to 0, they would be compensated with a certain % from swapping fees. This is a strong risk mitigation.\r\n\r\nAntfarm is even greater when markets are turbulent! This is when most swappers will be drawn to our pools. As ATF are required to pay for all swapping fees, the demand for ATF will be become substantial in such times."},"links":{"homepage":["https://antfarm.finance/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x518b63da813d46556fea041a88b52e3caa8c16a8","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x518b63da813d46556fea041a88b52e3caa8c16a8","https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/token/0x40df0c3bbaae5ea3a509d8f2aa9e086776c98e6c","https://arbiscan.io/token/0xfb9fbcb328317123f5275cda30b6589d5841216b","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/6YuMk7zXsV","https://medium.com/@antfarmfinance",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"antfarmfinance","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"antfarmfinance","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/AntfarmFinance/"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/28821/thumb/ATF.png?1681189807","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/28821/small/ATF.png?1681189807","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/28821/large/ATF.png?1681189807"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0x518b63da813d46556fea041a88b52e3caa8c16a8","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":95,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":null,"coingecko_score":0,"developer_score":0,"community_score":0,"liquidity_score":0,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-12T06:39:03.142Z"}
