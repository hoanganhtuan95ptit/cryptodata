It is designed to unlock holder’s position by opening up a whole new market for linSPIRIT, while still being able to enjoy weekly volume based fees from inSPIRIT.\r\nUsers can then swap their SPIRIT for linSPIRIT at a 1:1 ratio using our LiquidSwapper. In order to trade their linSPIRIT back to SPIRIT, users will need to use a DEX, such as SpiritSwap.\r\nWhen users swap SPIRIT for linSPIRIT, we lock the SPIRIT forever on a weekly basis. We then use the inSPIRIT received to boost yields for the SPIRIT-FTM, wETH-FTM and wBTC-FTM pairs, increasing yields for xLQDR holders.\r\nPrevious experiments have shown that this strategy can be a massive success. Convex’s cvxCRV alone has attracted a market cap of over 300 million USD. Although users seem to accept the peg for products like these, it is ultimately market forces that control the price."},"links":{"homepage":["https://www.liquiddriver.finance/linspirit","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://ftmscan.com/token/0xc5713b6a0f26bf0fdc1c52b90cd184d950be515c","https://scan.meter.io/address/0xc5713b6a0f26bf0fdc1c52b90cd184d950be515c","https://ftmscan.com/address/0xc5713b6a0f26bf0fdc1c52b90cd184d950be515c","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.com/invite/6BvXc9Bbfu","",""],"announcement_url":["https://liquiddriver.medium.com/",""],"twitter_screen_name":"LiquidDriver","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"LiquidDriver","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/22634/thumb/pirate.4fb08b14.png?1642344628","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/22634/small/pirate.4fb08b14.png?1642344628","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/22634/large/pirate.4fb08b14.png?1642344628"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0xc5713b6a0f26bf0fdc1c52b90cd184d950be515c","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":461,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":5354,"coingecko_score":2.195,"developer_score":0,"community_score":9.066,"liquidity_score":1,"public_interest_score":0.002,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-13T15:19:07.880Z"}
