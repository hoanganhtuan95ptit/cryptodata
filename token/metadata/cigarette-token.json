There is the game equilibrium.\r\nThe \"CEO of Cryptopunks\" can write a Graffiti message in the web so that everybody can see it. They can also change the emission rate of $CIG by 20% each time, with a cooldown time of 2 epochs. It starts from 1000 $CIG emmitted per block, which is the maximum, and there is also a minimum emmision rate. The $CIG are emmitted to the LPers of the CIG-WETH pair in Sushiswap in a linearly proportional way, just as in any other liquidity mining program.\r\n\r\nIt can also be considered a Christmas airdrop to the PUNK community, where each PUNK holder is gifted with 100k CIG per PUNK they hold. It is similar in spirit to the style of the $SOS token, but focused on the more specific PUNK community. Hopefully, the PUNK community revolves around it with time and may use it for a wider variety of purposes, like a more advanced game or a DAO. Due to the decentralized nature of the project, it is not possible yet to determine how will it evolve."},"links":{"homepage":["https://cigtoken.eth.limo/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xCB56b52316041A62B6b5D0583DcE4A8AE7a3C629","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xcb56b52316041a62b6b5d0583dce4a8ae7a3c629","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.com/invite/tWTQa2Wsnd","",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"CigToken","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/0xTycoon/punksceo"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/22145/thumb/logo200.png?1676535394","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/22145/small/logo200.png?1676535394","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/22145/large/logo200.png?1676535394"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0xcb56b52316041a62b6b5d0583dce4a8ae7a3c629","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":152,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":3217,"coingecko_score":9.942,"developer_score":33.452,"community_score":6.268,"liquidity_score":1,"public_interest_score":0.011,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-12T12:12:42.873Z"}
