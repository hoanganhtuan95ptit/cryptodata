A portion of the fees paid by anyone using Beefy’s yield optimization vaults are distributed to holders of $BIFI staked on the platform.

Users can request new vaults directly from Beefy’s developers and the time it takes to answer these requests is very low.\r\n\r\nWhat are yield farming and yield optimization?\r\n\r\nYield farming is simply a way to make some interest with crypto holdings. A yield optimizer is an automated service that seeks to gain the maximum possible return on crypto-investments made through DeFi platforms. They work much more efficiently than attempting to maximize yield through manual means. Each yield optimization method on Beefy Finance has its own unique strategy for farming, which normally involves the reinvestment of crypto assets staked in liquidity pools. At the most simple level, it farms the rewards given from staked assets and reinvests them back into the liquidity pool for the user.\r\n\r\nWhat are Beefy vaults?\r\n\r\nVaults are investment instruments that employ an optimized set of strategies for yield farming. They make use of automation to continually invest and reinvest deposited funds, which help to achieve high levels of compounded interest. Vaults are the core of the Beefy Finance ecosystem. In a Beefy vault, you earn more of the asset you stake, regardless of whether it’s a liquidity pool (LP) token or a single asset.\r\n\r\nDespite what the name 'vault' suggests, user funds are never locked on Beefy.Finance.

This is shared with all other stakers in that specific vault. Users should also consider network transaction fees when adding or removing funds.
