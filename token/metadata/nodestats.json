The new votings will be posted here when we are ready https://nodestats.info/voting.php so keep an eye on the website. To request a coin or a feature, the user needs to join the discord server and post their suggestions in the request channels. Then we will look at them, and make votings from them. I hope this new website will bring you a lot of useful information for your investing, and that you will use the system for future listings and features."},"links":{"homepage":["https://nodestats.info/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://nodestats.info/","","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/cRCF3BqHsk","",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":5317622,"telegram_channel_identifier":"","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/NODESTATS-NS/nodestats"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/14286/thumb/Round-black.png?1615274391","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/14286/small/Round-black.png?1615274391","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/14286/large/Round-black.png?1615274391"},"country_origin":"DK","genesis_date":null,"sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":164,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":4721,"coingecko_score":3.368,"developer_score":12.67,"community_score":0,"liquidity_score":1,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-14T02:10:50.054Z"}
