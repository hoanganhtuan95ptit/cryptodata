CyberVein is made to integrate the form of data economy in various aspects with the block chain technology as the core.

However, the existing DAG in the project before the release unit verification, most are using PoW and CyberVein will use our PoC mechanism is put forward.\r\nCyberVein contribution to prove: a response to block in the chain of the abuse of power or force concentrated and algorithm. PoC is based on the user's contribution to the network, add the appropriate hash calculation, to determine whether can win in the competition mechanism in the network. In traditional blockchain PoC can be used in the process of mining.\r\nIn each have the same hash miners work force, contribute more to the network resources miners (such as he contributed more hard disk capacity, or bandwidth, or power, etc.) will have smaller hash difficulty, so as to have more chance to beat competitors in the probability, acquired the right to the manufacture of new blocks.\r\nIn the DAG, when a user has more units under the condition of (he contributed more hard disk storage unit in the network), it will be more likely to reference the existing units, and obtain the corresponding fees.\r\nIOTA and Byteball projects in PoW validation of the role is mainly used to prevent the witch attacks and network to some extent abuse problems, and we believe that the use of PoC and other mechanisms, and can be done at the same time, encourage more users to participate in and contribution to the attack of prevention effect."},"links":{"homepage":["http://www.cybervein.org/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xbe428c3867f05dea2a89fc76a102b544eac7f772","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xbe428c3867f05dea2a89fc76a102b544eac7f772","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://t.me/cybervein","",""],"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@CyberVein",""],"twitter_screen_name":"cyberveingroup","facebook_username":"cyberveinteam","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":5250086,"telegram_channel_identifier":"CyberVeinCommunity","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CyberVeinOfficial/","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/Cyberveinofficial/CyberVeinChain"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3886/thumb/CyberVein_LOGO.png?1616062326","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3886/small/CyberVein_LOGO.png?1616062326","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3886/large/CyberVein_LOGO.png?1616062326"},"country_origin":"SG","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0xbe428c3867f05dea2a89fc76a102b544eac7f772","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":739,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":3420,"coingecko_score":8.544,"developer_score":0,"community_score":37.925,"liquidity_score":1,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":1496571,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-12T14:07:00.793Z"}
