By leveraging blockchain technology and a unique Proof of Action distribution algorithm, Galvan is turning self-care into a reward-generating activity and reintroducing personal accountability.\r\n\r\nWhat is IZE?\r\n\r\nPut Galvan and IZE together and you get galvanize: to shock or excite someone into taking action. IZE is the native utility token of the Galvan Blockchain and incentivizes all the right actions in the ecosystem, from running a node to going on a run.\r\n\r\nIZE is used for:\r\n- Fees for processing transactions\r\n- Staking for new voting proposals\r\n- Rewarding active Node Owners\r\n- Rewarding healthy decisions in the Galvan Wellness App (coming soon)\r\n- Purchasing health and wellness products in the Galvan Marketplace (coming soon)\r\n\r\nYou can get a deeper dive of IZE in Galvan’s Litepaper: https://www.galvan.health/litepaper\r\n\r\nWhat is the Galvan Blockchain?\r\n\r\nThe Galvan Blockchain is a layer-2 of Ethereum focused specifically on empowering wellness.
