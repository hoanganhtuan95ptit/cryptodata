Bob Eco offers asset finance to spur human potential across emerging markets. The project challenges the status quo and offers underserved people a frictionless opportunity to purchase a Bob vehicle and earn a stable income. \r\n\r\nBobcoin is a social asset-backed crypto—a cryptographically secured representation of the rights of a Bobcoin holder to receive a benefit from their tokens. As every Bobcoin is linked to an electric vehicle managed by Bob Eco, the tokens are always backed by the value of the asset they represent. These assets cover electric vehicles and objects in the Bob Eco system, which both clean the environment and help people in developing countries to make a living."},"links":{"homepage":["https://bob.eco","https://bob.solar","https://bobfleet.eco"],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xe803178b48A0e560C2b19F3b3d4e504f79D229ce","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xe803178b48a0e560c2b19f3b3d4e504f79d229ce","https://bscscan.com/token/0xCE6bD1833BD077f62B2c1F9a777bB829801d6811","https://polygonscan.com/token/0x590eb2920486486c2D9Bb3EB651f73b81df87bcf","https://snowtrace.io/token/0x590eb2920486486c2d9bb3eb651f73b81df87bcf","https://avascan.info/blockchain/c/address/0x590eb2920486486c2d9bb3eb651f73b81df87bcf/token","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr7ea3KYY7UUAD2iWowQGLw","https://www.facebook.com/BobEcoLtd/","https://www.linkedin.com/company/bob-eco/"],"chat_url":["https://www.instagram.com/bob.eco.coin/","https://t.me/bobEcoNews",""],"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@BobEco",""],"twitter_screen_name":"","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/CryptoMechanics/bobc-token"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/24264/thumb/bobc.png?1647171532","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/24264/small/bobc.png?1647171532","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/24264/large/bobc.png?1647171532"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0xe803178b48a0e560c2b19f3b3d4e504f79d229ce","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":0,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":100,"watchlist_portfolio_users":100201,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":3846,"coingecko_score":6.131,"developer_score":15.641,"community_score":0,"liquidity_score":11.103,"public_interest_score":0.001,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-12T10:14:25.360Z"}
