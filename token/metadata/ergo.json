Using ErgoScript, users can encode the conditions under which coins may be used: who can spend them, when, under what external conditions, to whom, and so on. Extended support for light nodes makes Ergo friendly for end users because it allows running contracts on untrusted commodity hardware.To be usable in the long-term, Ergo follows a survivability approach – it uses widely-researched solutions that do not result in security issues in the future, while also preventing performance degradation over time with a new economic model. Finally, Ergo has a self-amendable protocol that allows it to absorb new ideas and improve itself in the future."},"links":{"homepage":["https://ergoplatform.org/en/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/","","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["https://ergoplatform.org/docs/whitepaper.pdf","",""],"chat_url":["","",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"ergoplatformorg","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":5150971,"telegram_channel_identifier":"ergoplatform","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ergonauts/","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2484/thumb/Ergo.png?1574682618","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2484/small/Ergo.png?1574682618","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2484/large/Ergo.png?1574682618"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"sentiment_votes_up_percentage":82.35,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":17.65,"ico_data":{"ico_start_date":null,"ico_end_date":null,"short_desc":"Ergo Platform: A Resilient Platform For Contractual Money","description":null,"links":{},"softcap_currency":"","hardcap_currency":"","total_raised_currency":"","softcap_amount":null,"hardcap_amount":null,"total_raised":null,"quote_pre_sale_currency":"","base_pre_sale_amount":null,"quote_pre_sale_amount":null,"quote_public_sale_currency":"","base_public_sale_amount":0,"quote_public_sale_amount":0,"accepting_currencies":"","country_origin":"","pre_sale_start_date":null,"pre_sale_end_date":null,"whitelist_url":"","whitelist_start_date":null,"whitelist_end_date":null,"bounty_detail_url":"","amount_for_sale":null,"kyc_required":true,"whitelist_available":null,"pre_sale_available":null,"pre_sale_ended":false},"watchlist_portfolio_users":38234,"market_cap_rank":288,"coingecko_rank":50,"coingecko_score":50.604,"developer_score":80.453,"community_score":39.721,"liquidity_score":37.498,"public_interest_score":0.008,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":734986,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-13T12:44:22.234Z"}
