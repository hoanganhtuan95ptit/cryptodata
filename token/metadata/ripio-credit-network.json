The smart contracts connect agents with information on the borrower’s identity to agents that analyze the borrower’s credit risk impartially, thus standardizing credit lending through blockchain technology. A cosigner acts as a reinsurer that distributes and reduces the lender’s risk and, at the same time, helps to improve the contract conditions by retaining access to the borrower’s local legal system.","links":{"web":"https://ripiocredit.network","github":"https://github.com/ripio/rcn-token","medium":"https://medium.com/@rcn_news/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/RCN_token","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ripiocredit.network/","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/ripio-credit-network","telegram":"https://t.me/RCNtalk","whitepaper":"https://ripiocredit.network/wp/RCN%20Whitepaper%20ENG.pdf","bitcointalk":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2202647.0"},"softcap_currency":"","hardcap_currency":"","total_raised_currency":"","softcap_amount":null,"hardcap_amount":null,"total_raised":null,"quote_pre_sale_currency":"","base_pre_sale_amount":null,"quote_pre_sale_amount":null,"quote_public_sale_currency":"","base_public_sale_amount":0,"quote_public_sale_amount":0,"accepting_currencies":"","country_origin":"","pre_sale_start_date":null,"pre_sale_end_date":null,"whitelist_url":"","whitelist_start_date":null,"whitelist_end_date":null,"bounty_detail_url":"","amount_for_sale":null,"kyc_required":true,"whitelist_available":null,"pre_sale_available":null,"pre_sale_ended":false},"watchlist_portfolio_users":4411,"market_cap_rank":2029,"coingecko_rank":345,"coingecko_score":31.335,"developer_score":57.411,"community_score":27.153,"liquidity_score":1,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":1886227,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-14T03:33:45.709Z"}
