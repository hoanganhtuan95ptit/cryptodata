Rather, the transactions are verified by nodes (the network of computers/users spread globally) and recorded in an open ledger.\r\n\r\nWhat does it aim to solve?\r\n\r\nWith a shorter block period than Bitcoin, Groestlcoin aims to be more functional for everyday payments. Merchants don’t need to wait 10 minutes to confirm whether or not they have received their payment. The reduction in hashrate intensity also gave Groestlcoin an opportunity to be mined by individuals with less computing power. However, companies and teams have created ASICs for Groestlcoin, albeit at a higher cost than creating ASICs for Bitcoin. Rather than just a simple fork, Groestlcoin also works to adopt developments and additions inspired from discussions surrounding the Bitcoin network, and was actually one of the first adopters to several key features such as Segregated Witness (SegWit) and the Lightning Network."},"links":{"homepage":["http://www.groestlcoin.com/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://chainz.cryptoid.info/grs/","https://blockchair.com/groestlcoin","https://grs.tokenview.io/","https://blockbook.groestlcoin.org/","http://groestlsight.groestlcoin.org/","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["http://www.groestlcoin.org/forum/","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.com/invite/4gW2qrTfSy","https://www.facebook.com/groestlcoin/",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"GroestlcoinTeam","facebook_username":"GroestlCoinGRS","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":525926,"telegram_channel_identifier":"","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/groestlcoin","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/GroestlCoin/GroestlCoin"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/71/thumb/image001.png?1547033733","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/71/small/image001.png?1547033733","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/71/large/image001.png?1547033733"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":"2014-03-22","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":3926,"market_cap_rank":540,"coingecko_rank":44,"coingecko_score":50.953,"developer_score":75.265,"community_score":43.05,"liquidity_score":48.833,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":4271463,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[{"description":"Click here for the Groestlcoin 22/9/22 Release!  https://medium.com/@groestlcoinnews/grs-september-update-2022-2e4d577baf7d","category":"software_release","created_at":"2022-09-22T18:59:08.679Z","user":"Adam","user_title":"Developer","pin":true,"project":{"type":"Coin","id":"groestlcoin","name":"Groestlcoin","symbol":"grs","image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/71/thumb/image001.png?1547033733","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/71/small/image001.png?1547033733","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/71/large/image001.png?1547033733"}}},{"description":"BitcartCC has now support for $GRS.
