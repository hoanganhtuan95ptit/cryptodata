Our mission is to enable cheap, fast, safe cross-chain value exchange across all blockchains. We hope to see a future where the crypto community becomes even more inclusive and where walls between chains are a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nElk Finance has already launched on the Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom Opera and Huobi Eco networks. The ElkNet bridge that allows cross-chain transfers is live & provides the functionality to move $ELK between all chains in about 7 seconds with no fee."},"links":{"homepage":["https://elk.finance/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://snowtrace.io/token/0xeEeEEb57642040bE42185f49C52F7E9B38f8eeeE","https://avascan.info/blockchain/c/address/0xeeeeeb57642040be42185f49c52f7e9b38f8eeee/token","https://ftmscan.com/token/0xeeeeeb57642040be42185f49c52f7e9b38f8eeee","https://cronos-explorer.crypto.org/token/0xeeeeeb57642040be42185f49c52f7e9b38f8eeee","https://gnosisscan.io/token/0xeeeeeb57642040be42185f49c52f7e9b38f8eeee","https://esc.elastos.io/token/0xeeeeeb57642040be42185f49c52f7e9b38f8eeee","https://moonriver.moonscan.io/token/0xeeeeeb57642040be42185f49c52f7e9b38f8eeee","https://explorer.fuse.io/token/0xeeeeeb57642040be42185f49c52f7e9b38f8eeee","https://polygonscan.com/token/0xeeeeeb57642040be42185f49c52f7e9b38f8eeee","https://etherscan.io/token/0xeeeeeb57642040be42185f49c52f7e9b38f8eeee"],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/4BMRV6mB","https://www.facebook.com/ElkFinance-102986305344259",""],"announcement_url":["https://elk-finance.medium.com/",""],"twitter_screen_name":"elk_finance","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"elk_finance_chat","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ElkFinance/","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/elkfinance"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/17813/thumb/elk.png?1629336971","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/17813/small/elk.png?1629336971","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/17813/large/elk.png?1629336971"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0xeeeeeb57642040be42185f49c52f7e9b38f8eeee","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":3782,"market_cap_rank":1852,"coingecko_rank":1180,"coingecko_score":19.916,"developer_score":0,"community_score":30.409,"liquidity_score":11.386,"public_interest_score":0.005,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-13T12:35:31.655Z"}
