Depending on each holder’s percentage of ownership, a 2% transaction tax is distributed among all holders—this includes the burn wallet, which is essentially a holder that collects more tokens over time as transactions occur. As the circulating supply decreases, the scarcity of the token increases. This inversely proportional relationship constitutes a supply and demand model. There is no limit as to how many tokens can be burnt.
