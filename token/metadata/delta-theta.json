Currently, the solution is implemented on the following blockchains: Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum.\r\n\r\nThe platform architecture, as part of the implementation on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain and Ethereum, supports the following functionality: \r\n● Unlimited expirations \r\n● Pairing of any coins for the corresponding blockchain \r\n● American-style options (execute at any time prior to expiration date) \r\n● Limit and market orders. Limit order - user chooses the parameters (price, term). Market order - the user buys/sells what is available in the trading terminal. \r\n● 2-level system of commissions.

Thus, the farmer needs to get protection from the dump of the token that is being farmed. \r\n2. Efficient capital management. Today's farmers in search of APY growth use quite a wide range of products, from simple farming to flashloans solutions. Options allow them to participate with less capital leverage. We started out with a simple one - by allowing farmers to sell options. You sell an option - and you make money. \r\n\r\nThe farmer has an opportunity to make money on his desire to use his own capital more efficiently. Example: A farmer wants to sell a coin at a higher price and comes to delta.theta, he uses the Sell High option and places a limit order through the delta.theta LITE app and the magic begins: a. first, his order can go into LIP (disabling feature) - this means that his order is deposited on the Venus protocol and the farmer is paid the appropriate APY b. Secondly, if the buyer bought the farmer's option, he paid him a premium. But the option may not be executed.
