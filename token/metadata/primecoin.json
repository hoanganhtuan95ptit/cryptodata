Thus primecoin network is energy-multiuse, compared to <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">bitcoin</a> network. Primecoin is designed to sustain a prosperous mining market and high level of security, while maintaining good scarcity property like gold.

Not taking into account Bitcoin’s massive headstart, Primecoin may well be the first alternative coin to actually be better than Bitcoin, giving the currency the potential for a bright future ahead.","fi":"Primecoin is a rather interesting digital currency.
