District0x aims to develop a flexible, and free market with advanced entrepreneurial concepts.\r\n\r\nThe District0x infrastructure has a very neat concept with some well-outlined features, such as the staking interface. A staking interface is put in place that allows DNT holders to have open control over the districts through an Aragon governance layer for all markets that come online. Post creation of a district, an Aragon entity will also be created that people can use to interact with this staking mechanism. After staking a user will receive voting rights in that district.  Using the creation interface, one can remove central power structures from any marketplace without the additional need for development or programming skills.

DNT tokens can be staked in districts, thus they not only give voting power and privileges within that district but also provide district-specific tokens depending on when the investor had started trading.

DNT tokens can be staked in districts, thus they not only give voting power and privileges within that district but also provide district-specific tokens depending on when the investor had started trading.

Districts exist as decentralized autonomous organizations on the district0x Network. All districts will be built upon a standard open-source framework, d0xINFRA. Modeled after the Ethlance stack, the d0xINFRA framework is comprised of Ethereum smart contracts and front-end libraries. To provide all internet citizens with an opportunity to freely join and contribute to any district, to align incentives across all of a district’s participants, and to implement coordinated decision-making mechanisms to the district0x Network, they introduce the district0x Network Token. The district0x Network Token (DNT) is a staking token, used by holders to join districts and participate in their governance. Upon staking district0x Network Tokens to a district, participants receive an equivalent amount of voting rights in the district. Voting rights can be used to partake in the processes that determine everything from a district’s branding, to its accepted code of conduct, to the auxiliary modules that are integrated, to the way that fees collected by revenue-generating auxiliary modules are utilized, and beyond.","links":{"web":"https://district0x.io/","blog":"https://blog.district0x.io/","slack":"https://district0x-slack.herokuapp.com/","github":"https://github.com/district0x/name-bazaar","twitter":"https://twitter.com/district0x","facebook":"","telegram":"","whitepaper":"https://district0x.io/docs/district0x-whitepaper.pdf"},"softcap_currency":"ETH","hardcap_currency":"ETH","total_raised_currency":"USD","softcap_amount":"58550.0","hardcap_amount":"292750.0","total_raised":"9000000.0","quote_pre_sale_currency":"","base_pre_sale_amount":null,"quote_pre_sale_amount":null,"quote_public_sale_currency":"","base_public_sale_amount":0,"quote_public_sale_amount":0,"accepting_currencies":"","country_origin":"US","pre_sale_start_date":null,"pre_sale_end_date":null,"whitelist_url":"","whitelist_start_date":null,"whitelist_end_date":null,"bounty_detail_url":"","amount_for_sale":null,"kyc_required":true,"whitelist_available":null,"pre_sale_available":null,"pre_sale_ended":false},"watchlist_portfolio_users":13082,"market_cap_rank":689,"coingecko_rank":154,"coingecko_score":40.764,"developer_score":57.858,"community_score":36.68,"liquidity_score":26.264,"public_interest_score":0.001,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":346319,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-12T12:23:46.412Z"}
