How do you trust others? We say that we trust people not when they are friendly, but when we can transparently know who they are for a long time. What about commercial services? Why do we trust Amazon, Google, Apple and Samsung and give them all my card and personal information? We did not trust these services in the first place. These services became trustworthy with the value of their company based on secure long term interaction with users and technologies.

It is a new concept that aims to bridge the gap between centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). \r\n\r\nThe idea behind CeDeFi is to take the best aspects of both CeFi and DeFi and combine them to create a financial ecosystem that is more efficient, transparent, and user-friendly.\r\n\r\nCeFi has a reputation for stability, security and regulatory compliance, but it can be lacking in terms of transparency and accessibility.
