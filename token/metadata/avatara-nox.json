(Avatar: NFT)\r\nUsers sign-up for a guild in the AVATARA universe, grow their characters, participate in battles and wars to earn rare items and utility tokens. In addition, items and avatars (NFT), and even characters can be freely traded among users in the game.\r\n\r\nPreviously unguaranteed in WEB2 MMORPGs, this is returning the ownership of items and characters back to the users. Although we have just begun, the AVATARA team plans to expand beyond our platform and into the vast WEB3 world.\r\n\r\nWe focus on the fun of ‘possible embodiments’. We believe that a game that ‘provides entertainment through real embodiments’, rather than merely ‘overlaying’ blockchain/NFT technologies, is the catalyst of bringing WEB2 users to WEB3.\r\n\r\nTo do so, in PHASE 1, the focus will be placed on an MMROPG game’s most important ‘fun of battles’ and ‘improving business models and approachability’ of the blockchain. In PHASE 2, expansion will be focused on the ‘interoperability’ of the WEB3. This is so because we believe that WEB 3 can only operate when users show continuous joy playing a game with a strong base.\r\n\r\nAVATARA has a multi-token economy system using NOX/TARA as a means to enjoy the game more vividly.
