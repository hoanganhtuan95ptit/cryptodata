Mintlayer is opening up new ways for the DeFi sector to integrate with Bitcoin to enable real-world financial use cases on the Bitcoin blockchain.\r\n\r\n\r\nMintlayer USP - Atomic Swaps\r\nWhile other projects are trying to enable DeFi on Bitcoin, Mintlayer is the only protocol that enables direct 1:1 swap of Native Bitcoin for other tokenized assets Minted directly on Mintlayer. With these atomic swaps on Mintlayer, there are no intermediaries, peg-in, wrapped, or federated tokens. No other project has approached asset swaps in this manner, and it enables users to use native Bitcoin for financial instruments without counterparty or intermediary risk.    \r\n\r\nAdditional Features: \r\n-Unlike Ethereum, users can choose any token to pay transaction fees.\r\n\r\n-With Turing incomplete smart contracts, Mintlayer reduces the risk of contract failure and increases outcome predictability.
