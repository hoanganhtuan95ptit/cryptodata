We have several enterprises & apps being built on Rubix currently in verticals like ESG, carbon credits, NFTs, telecom, gaming & stablecoins.","bg":"Rubix is an L1 blockchain protocol consisting of thousands of proofchains that always compose to one global state without needing centralized coordinators.  The architecture is modular where apps/enterprises can build subnets, merge them, detach them, all on a public chain with one swarm key.  This modular architecture with multi-threading results in parallelism & ultra high scalability.  It also helps in achieving zero gas fees.  Rubix is the only L1 with decentralized identity built right from the scratch.  Rubix also solves the state storage problem seen in other chains - Rubix is highly storage efficient & hence ideal for Web3 applications.  RBT is the native utility token, which is a must to perform a peer to peer transaction on the chain.  Miners are incentivized with RBT rewards.  There will be a maximum of 51.4 million tokens eventually, of which about 6 million are mined.  Rubix node can be run any system with 8GB RAM & i5 processor, does not need high end ASIC nodes.
