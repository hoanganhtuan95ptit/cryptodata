","sl":"Danketsu (formerly known as ADA NinjaZ) is a Web3 media and entertainment business featuring NFTs, literature (manga-comics, screenplays, light novels, books), music, and gamified experiences, with existing intellectual properties of value, and an established community. Its latest deliverable is designed to solve the various problems in today’s gaming industry, including lack of proof of concept; lack of quality or true gaming experience; too much focus on token economy (or the “earn” rather than the “play” part); and not developed by gaming professionals.\r\n\r\nDanketsu’s products are based on intellectual properties (IPs) co-developed by the team and its community. Over the last year, Danketsu has successfully proven the value of their IPs through the launch of various non-fungible token (NFT)-based media products, including the four collections of Danketsu digital art, the two series of manga-comics (including a physical NFT-linked copy), one light novel, and an animation episode screenplay. The team, with input from the Danketsu community, has also co-produced five songs. Based on the community’s interest, Danketsu is now in the process of developing an NFT web-based gamified staking platform called Danketsu Missions.
