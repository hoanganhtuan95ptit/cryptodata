No matter what type of NFT or token user holds within the ecosystem, there will always be different options how to spend or use it, and other strategies that user can choose to benefit as part of the RektSkulls project.\r\n\r\n## What is REKT token?\r\n\r\n* The native token is the key part of the RektSkulls ecosystem, every product, service, and mechanic within the ecosystem is paid by REKT token.\r\n* Has 2.5% tax mechanic on sell/buy/transfer transactions (except interaction with project mechanics, such as auctions). Tax mechanic is the only source of funding for project. \r\n* 95% of $REKT token is obtained from Essences and LP staking.\r\n* 5% reserved for future in-game economy bootstrap.\r\n* Has burn mechanics - all token from the winning bid of Genesis Skulls auctions are burned.
