This ensures that all transaction data is encrypted and only accessible by the involved parties, making Berylbit suitable for applications that require a high level of privacy, such as financial transactions or personal data management.\r\n\r\nBerylbit also supports smart contracts in multiple programming languages, which makes it highly customizable and flexible. Developers can create smart contracts in the programming language they are most comfortable with, without being limited by the language supported by the blockchain. This feature allows Berylbit to be more accessible to developers and to support a wider range of applications and use cases.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Berylbit's architecture allows for interoperability with other blockchains and DeFi protocols. This enables users to access DeFi services and interact with other blockchains, making Berylbit a more versatile and connected blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nOverall, Berylbit's use of zk rollups and its architecture on top of the Ethereum network and Arbitrum layer 2 network offer several technological benefits that are critical for blockchain development. Its scalability, privacy, flexibility, and interoperability make it an excellent choice for developers and businesses looking to build innovative blockchain solutions. Whether you want to create a DeFi application, a gaming platform, or anything else, Berylbit can help you build a scalable, secure, and flexible solution.\r\n\r\n"},"links":{"homepage":["https://berylbit.org/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://bscscan.com/token/0xca0823d3d04b9faea7803ccb87fa8596775190dd","","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["https://t.me/BerylBitNews","","https://www.facebook.com/BerylBit-BRB-106941328533189"],"chat_url":["","",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"brbberylbit","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"BerylBit","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/BerylBit"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/22239/thumb/IMG-20230330-081241-471.jpg?1680230398","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/22239/small/IMG-20230330-081241-471.jpg?1680230398","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/22239/large/IMG-20230330-081241-471.jpg?1680230398"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0xca0823d3d04b9faea7803ccb87fa8596775190dd","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":0,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":100,"watchlist_portfolio_users":972,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":6651,"coingecko_score":0.898,"developer_score":0,"community_score":3.173,"liquidity_score":1,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-10T18:15:04.325Z"}
