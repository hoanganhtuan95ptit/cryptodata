The video streaming services on Theta rely on a distributed network of users who voluntarily contribute their spare bandwidth and computing resources to run Theta’s system, in return for Theta Fuel (TFuel) reward.\r\n\r\nTheta runs on a modified proof-of-stake consensus mechanism as it has a unique multi-Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) which combines a committee of 20-30 Validator nodes with a second later of thousands of Guardian nodes. This acts to speed up approvals and is faster than traditional proof-of-work networks. Theta’s multi-BFT design achieves a healthy balance between consistency, speed, and decentralization."},"links":{"homepage":["https://www.thetatoken.org/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://explorer.thetatoken.org","https://explorer.energi.network/token/0x65622f8e8b569ade3f684b5f2a189f78f98a75b0","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.com/invite/nC8mCkgEmV","https://www.facebook.com/ThetaNetwork/",""],"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/theta-network",""],"twitter_screen_name":"Theta_Network","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2451089,"telegram_channel_identifier":"","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/thetatoken/theta-protocol-ledger","https://github.com/thetatoken/theta-infrastructure-vault","https://github.com/thetatoken/theta-infrastructure-ledger-explorer","https://github.com/thetatoken/theta-protocol-delivery-lib"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2538/thumb/theta-token-logo.png?1548387191","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2538/small/theta-token-logo.png?1548387191","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2538/large/theta-token-logo.png?1548387191"},"country_origin":"US","genesis_date":"2017-12-14","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":50,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":50,"ico_data":{"ico_start_date":"2018-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","ico_end_date":"2018-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","short_desc":"Next generation video delivery powered by you","description":null,"links":{},"softcap_currency":"","hardcap_currency":"USD","total_raised_currency":"USD","softcap_amount":null,"hardcap_amount":"20000000.0","total_raised":"20000000.0","quote_pre_sale_currency":"","base_pre_sale_amount":null,"quote_pre_sale_amount":null,"quote_public_sale_currency":"USD","base_public_sale_amount":1,"quote_public_sale_amount":0.15,"accepting_currencies":"ETH","country_origin":"US","pre_sale_start_date":null,"pre_sale_end_date":null,"whitelist_url":"","whitelist_start_date":null,"whitelist_end_date":null,"bounty_detail_url":"","amount_for_sale":"600000000.0","kyc_required":true,"whitelist_available":null,"pre_sale_available":null,"pre_sale_ended":false},"watchlist_portfolio_users":147977,"market_cap_rank":57,"coingecko_rank":52,"coingecko_score":50.183,"developer_score":60.646,"community_score":41.537,"liquidity_score":51.294,"public_interest_score":0.02,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":80855,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-11T03:21:42.205Z"}
