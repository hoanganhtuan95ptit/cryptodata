With a strong emphasis on confidentiality and security, Cipher Core empowers individuals to engage in financial interactions while safeguarding their wallet addresses.\r\n\r\nIn a landscape where privacy is becoming increasingly important, Cipher Core aims to empower individuals by providing a secure and confidential environment for their financial interactions. By using the \"Anon Pools\" within the Cipher Core ecosystem, users can achieve a heightened level of privacy and anonymity in their transactions.\r\n\r\nUsers can deposit their digital assets (ETH, BNB & ARB) into Anon Pools, providing a shield of anonymity for their funds. When it comes time to withdraw, users can conveniently retrieve their assets from any other wallet while maintaining their privacy.\r\n\r\nDAO protocol inside Cipher Core utilizes the $CIPHER token, allowing for users to reserve voting power for continued project developments and distribution of project revenue amongst holders."},"links":{"homepage":["https://ciphercore.io","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x9839675308f4a83e45f4b0c89b8fa264d68b7812","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x9839675308f4a83e45f4b0c89b8fa264d68b7812","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/ciphercore","","https://www.youtube.com/@CipherCore"],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"CipherPrivacy","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"ciphercoreofficial","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/30907/thumb/cipher_200x200.png?1688623648","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/30907/small/cipher_200x200.png?1688623648","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/30907/large/cipher_200x200.png?1688623648"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0x9839675308f4a83e45f4b0c89b8fa264d68b7812","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":14,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":null,"coingecko_score":0,"developer_score":0,"community_score":0,"liquidity_score":0,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":null}
