The protocol was initially developed by Ondo Finance, a software development firm in DeFi, before being sold to Flux Finance.\r\n\r\nFlux is governed by the Ondo DAO, in which ONDO holders vote to upgrade its code and alter its risk parameters. In February 2023, the protocol was initialized and its supported assets and parameters were selected in a genesis vote. fDAI was among the first assets to be selected, alongside fUSDC and fOUSG. Markets for these assets opened shortly after.\r\n\r\nWhat can fDAI be Used For?\r\nBy minting fDAI, users earn interest and gain the ability to use fDAI as collateral. fDAI can be transferred to effect change in ownership. Transferring fDAI means transferring your balance of the underlying DAI inside the Flux Finance protocol. Transfers that would result in negative account liquidity for borrowers on Flux Finance will fail.\r\n\r\nWhat’s Next for fDAI?\r\nAs a permissionless yielding asset, fDAI can in turn be used as collateral at other lending protocols, and offers an alternative settlement option between parties."},"links":{"homepage":["https://fluxfinance.com/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xe2bA8693cE7474900A045757fe0efCa900F6530b","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xe2bA8693cE7474900A045757fe0efCa900F6530b","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/YzhZaFbB92","https://blog.fluxfinance.com/",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"FluxDeFi","facebook_username":null,"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"+feNWURgESeoyMmRh","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/29052/thumb/fDAI_200x200.png?1676335235","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/29052/small/fDAI_200x200.png?1676335235","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/29052/large/fDAI_200x200.png?1676335235"},"country_origin":null,"genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0xe2ba8693ce7474900a045757fe0efca900f6530b","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":4,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":null,"coingecko_score":0,"developer_score":0,"community_score":0,"liquidity_score":0,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":null}
