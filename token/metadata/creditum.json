Creditum is a project from Revenant (formerly known as StakeSteak). This protocol uses over-collateralized deposits to mint debt tokens at a fixed interest rate, specifically cUSD (Creditum USD). Essentially, cUSD is meant to replace old fUSD with a new liquidation model that works.\r\n\r\nCreditum is a lending & borrowing protocol that allows users to mint cUSD, a stablecoin pegged at $1, by supplying collateral. By doing so, users are able to unlock more capital and use cUSD to earn yield on top of the assets they already own.\r\n\r\nSince Creditum requires an over-collateralization of deposits, each cUSD is backed by at least $1 of collateral.
