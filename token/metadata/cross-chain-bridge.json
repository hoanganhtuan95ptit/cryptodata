The Cross-Chain Bridge v2.0 has an ambitious goal: It should be possible to move as many tokens as possible to almost any network.\r\n\r\nThe Cross-Chain Bridge will attract and incentivize all players to participate in the ecosystem. Similar to projects launching tokens on Uniswap or a DEX, communities and/or creators will be able to add their own token via the Cross-Chain Bridge intuitively and permissionlessly, benefiting from greater accessibility and security. Meanwhile, yield farmers AND projects will be incentivized to provide liquidity with fee-participation and yield farming."},"links":{"homepage":["https://crosschainbridge.org/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x92868a5255c628da08f550a858a802f5351c5223","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x92868a5255c628da08f550a858a802f5351c5223","https://polygonscan.com/token/0x92868a5255c628da08f550a858a802f5351c5223","https://bscscan.com/token/0x92868a5255c628da08f550a858a802f5351c5223","https://snowtrace.io/token/0xc0367f9b1f84ca8de127226ac2a994ea4bf1e41b","https://ftmscan.com/token/0x92868a5255c628da08f550a858a802f5351c5223","https://avascan.info/blockchain/c/address/0xc0367f9b1f84ca8de127226ac2a994ea4bf1e41b/token","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.com/invite/5gMJpWQfSX","",""],"announcement_url":["https://crosschainbridge.medium.com/",""],"twitter_screen_name":"ccb_bridge","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/crosschainbridge"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/20223/thumb/0x92868A5255C628dA08F550a858A802f5351C5223.png?1636684446","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/20223/small/0x92868A5255C628dA08F550a858A802f5351C5223.png?1636684446","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/20223/large/0x92868A5255C628dA08F550a858A802f5351C5223.png?1636684446"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0x92868a5255c628da08f550a858a802f5351c5223","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":754,"market_cap_rank":3308,"coingecko_rank":2844,"coingecko_score":11.556,"developer_score":0,"community_score":8.069,"liquidity_score":1,"public_interest_score":0.002,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-12T11:01:54.343Z"}
