Given the same amount of capital, Interest Protocol can generate more loans with less liquidity risk than existing lending protocols without fractional reserves.\r\n\r\nInterest Protocol automatically manages its reserve ratio—USDC in the protocol’s reserve over the total supply of USDi—by employing a variable interest rate system. As the reserve ratio decreases, the borrow and deposit rates of USDi increase, and vice versa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How Many IPT Tokens Are There in Circulation?\r\n\r\nAt launch, there will be 100 million IPT tokens in existence. 20% of this will be unissued and held in the protocol treasury. Through governance proposals, IPT holders can collectively decide to mint additional IPT tokens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Who Built Interest Protocol?\r\n\r\nInterest Protocol was developed by GFX Labs. GFX Labs started in 2021 with the goal of building web 3 applications that facilitate ownership and improve usability.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Where Can I Buy IPT?\r\n\r\nIPT can be purchased by participating in the [IPT sale](https://interestprotocol.io/#/sale)."},"links":{"homepage":["https://interestprotocol.io/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xd909c5862cdb164adb949d92622082f0092efc3d","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xd909c5862cdb164adb949d92622082f0092efc3d","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["https://forums.interestprotocol.io/","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/RBnmdZm7rr","https://medium.com/interest-protocol",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"InterestDeFi","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/gfx-labs/ip-contracts/"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/27000/thumb/logo.white_%281%29.png?1661328083","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/27000/small/logo.white_%281%29.png?1661328083","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/27000/large/logo.white_%281%29.png?1661328083"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0xd909c5862cdb164adb949d92622082f0092efc3d","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":65,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":3376,"coingecko_score":8.787,"developer_score":28.707,"community_score":6.407,"liquidity_score":1,"public_interest_score":0.001,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-10T07:59:46.321Z"}
