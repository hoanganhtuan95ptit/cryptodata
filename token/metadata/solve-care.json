Using the Solve.Care platform, businesses are able to launch networked, interoperable healthcare dApps, within only weeks or even days.  \r\n\r\nCare Networks on the Solve.Care platform use the SOLVE token, a utility token that is used for inter/intra network payments and transaction fees. It also has additional uses including developer rights, staking, marketplace payments, and platform access fees. \r\n\r\nWho is the Founder of Solve.Care?\r\n\r\nPradeep Goel, the Founder and CEO of Solve.Care, has extensive expertise in healthcare, finance and technology. Prior to Solve.Care, he had been in the CEO, COO, CIO and CTO roles at various innovative technology companies over 25 years\r\n\r\nPradeep was deeply involved in designing and building solutions for public programs such as Medicare/Medicaid, children health insurance and welfare programs, SNAP/TANF, health insurance exchanges and health information exchanges. He has worked for and with commercial insurance companies as the top technology executive, and implemented benefits administration, consumer engagement, claimed medication and payment systems. \r\n\r\nPradeep has built 4 healthcare IT companies and has been at the top of Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500, INC500/5000 fastest growing companies lists multiple times.

These business values include ease of usage, privacy, security, control and ownership of data, interoperability, auditability, and enhanced trust between parties.\r\n\r\nSolve.Care gives healthcare stakeholders a unique opportunity to build their own dApps to form Care Networks, connecting and synchronizing their participants, making instant payments inside their network, and sharing information immediately to reduce opportunities for fraud. \r\n\r\nSolve.Care is unique because it not only allows networks to run independently, but to also have a fabric underneath that allows them to all communicate.\r\n\r\nAll Care Networks are fully and intrinsically tokenized to manage events, identities, transactions, payments and data sharing using the SOLVE token, which is a combination of transaction fee payment token (like Ethereum as gas), as well as a normal payment currency. The SOLVE token also has a unique property of being able to function inside the Network, either as a variable value token or as a fixed value token (as a stable coin). This property makes it uniquely powerful and appropriate for healthcare usage. \r\n\r\n\r\nSolve.Care has built blockchain healthcare networks for the real-world clients such as Boehringer Ingelheim, Uber Health, Lyft, Aon, Arizona Care Network and others. \r\n\r\nSolve.Care is the first company in the world to successfully deploy digital currency and blockchain technology for value-based payments in US healthcare.

Using the Solve.Care platform, businesses are able to launch networked, interoperable healthcare dApps, within only weeks or even days.  \r\n\r\nCare Networks on the Solve.Care platform use the SOLVE token, a utility token that is used for inter/intra network payments and transaction fees. It also has additional uses including developer rights, staking, marketplace payments, and platform access fees. \r\n\r\nWho is the Founder of Solve.Care?\r\n\r\nPradeep Goel, the Founder and CEO of Solve.Care, has extensive expertise in healthcare, finance and technology. Prior to Solve.Care, he had been in the CEO, COO, CIO and CTO roles at various innovative technology companies over 25 years\r\n\r\nPradeep was deeply involved in designing and building solutions for public programs such as Medicare/Medicaid, children health insurance and welfare programs, SNAP/TANF, health insurance exchanges and health information exchanges. He has worked for and with commercial insurance companies as the top technology executive, and implemented benefits administration, consumer engagement, claimed medication and payment systems. \r\n\r\nPradeep has built 4 healthcare IT companies and has been at the top of Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500, INC500/5000 fastest growing companies lists multiple times.

These business values include ease of usage, privacy, security, control and ownership of data, interoperability, auditability, and enhanced trust between parties.\r\n\r\nSolve.Care gives healthcare stakeholders a unique opportunity to build their own dApps to form Care Networks, connecting and synchronizing their participants, making instant payments inside their network, and sharing information immediately to reduce opportunities for fraud. \r\n\r\nSolve.Care is unique because it not only allows networks to run independently, but to also have a fabric underneath that allows them to all communicate.\r\n\r\nAll Care Networks are fully and intrinsically tokenized to manage events, identities, transactions, payments and data sharing using the SOLVE token, which is a combination of transaction fee payment token (like Ethereum as gas), as well as a normal payment currency. The SOLVE token also has a unique property of being able to function inside the Network, either as a variable value token or as a fixed value token (as a stable coin). This property makes it uniquely powerful and appropriate for healthcare usage. \r\n\r\n\r\nSolve.Care has built blockchain healthcare networks for the real-world clients such as Boehringer Ingelheim, Uber Health, Lyft, Aon, Arizona Care Network and others. \r\n\r\nSolve.Care is the first company in the world to successfully deploy digital currency and blockchain technology for value-based payments in US healthcare.
