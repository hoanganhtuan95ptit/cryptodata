This technology enables creation of personalized oracles that maintain user’s DeFi positions using decentralized and non-custodial protocols to increase the security and convenience of crypto asset management. The Fetch.ai network is an interchain protocol, based on the Cosmos-SDK, and uses a high-performance WASM-based smart contract language (Cosmwasm) to allow advanced cryptography and machine learning logic to be implemented on chain. This also allows the Fetch.ai network to serve as a layer-2 network for Ethereum and as an interchain bridge to the rest of the blockchain world."},"links":{"homepage":["https://fetch.ai/","https://colearn-paint.fetch.ai/vote",""],"blockchain_site":["https://explore.fetch.ai/","https://www.mintscan.io/fetchai/","https://etherscan.io/token/0xaea46A60368A7bD060eec7DF8CBa43b7EF41Ad85","https://bscscan.com/token/0x031b41e504677879370e9dbcf937283a8691fa7f","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xaea46A60368A7bD060eec7DF8CBa43b7EF41Ad85","https://atomscan.com/fetchai","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/WcgB7X2Kp9","",""],"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/fetch-ai",""],"twitter_screen_name":"fetch_ai","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"fetch_ai","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/FetchAI_Community/","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/fetchai/fetchd","https://github.com/fetchai/cosmos-sdk","https://github.com/fetchai/cosmos-explorer","https://github.com/fetchai/agents-aea","https://github.com/fetchai/ledger"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/5681/thumb/Fetch.jpg?1572098136","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/5681/small/Fetch.jpg?1572098136","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/5681/large/Fetch.jpg?1572098136"},"country_origin":"GB","genesis_date":"2019-02-25","contract_address":"0xaea46a60368a7bd060eec7df8cba43b7ef41ad85","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":90.48,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":9.52,"ico_data":{"ico_start_date":"2018-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","ico_end_date":"2018-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","short_desc":"Fetch.AI is an Artificial Intelligence and Digital Economics company.","description":null,"links":{},"softcap_currency":"","hardcap_currency":"USD","total_raised_currency":"USD","softcap_amount":null,"hardcap_amount":"30000000.0","total_raised":"15000000.0","quote_pre_sale_currency":"","base_pre_sale_amount":null,"quote_pre_sale_amount":null,"quote_public_sale_currency":"USD","base_public_sale_amount":1,"quote_public_sale_amount":0.0867,"accepting_currencies":"ETH","country_origin":"GB","pre_sale_start_date":"2018-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","pre_sale_end_date":"2018-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","whitelist_url":"https://tokenmarket.net/preregistration/fetch/enter","whitelist_start_date":"2018-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","whitelist_end_date":null,"bounty_detail_url":"","amount_for_sale":"230599515.0","kyc_required":true,"whitelist_available":true,"pre_sale_available":true,"pre_sale_ended":false},"watchlist_portfolio_users":89244,"market_cap_rank":143,"coingecko_rank":84,"coingecko_score":46.817,"developer_score":65.051,"community_score":36.307,"liquidity_score":45.782,"public_interest_score":0.003,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":294127,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-13T13:02:52.219Z"}
