Storj is a platform, cryptocurrency, and suite of decentralized applications that allows users to store data in a secure and decentralized manner. It uses blockchain features like a transaction ledger, public/private key encryption, and cryptographic hash functions for security. Furthermore, it will be way cheaper (10x-to-100x), faster, and more secure than traditional cloud storage services.Storj is working hard to solve data security issues with the help of its own web app, Storj Share, and Libstorj. It is a decentralized, end-to-end encrypted cloud storage that uses blockchain technology and cryptography to secure online files. There is no need to trust a corporation, vulnerable servers, or employees with your files. Storj completely removes trust from the equation.","links":{"web":"https://storj.io/tokensale","blog":"","github":"https://github.com/Storj/storjshare-daemon","twitter":"https://twitter.com/storjproject","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/storjproject","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/3839986/","telegram":"https://t.me/storjproject","whitepaper":"https://storj.io/storj.pdf"},"softcap_currency":"","hardcap_currency":"","total_raised_currency":"USD","softcap_amount":null,"hardcap_amount":null,"total_raised":"30000000.0","quote_pre_sale_currency":"","base_pre_sale_amount":null,"quote_pre_sale_amount":null,"quote_public_sale_currency":"USD","base_public_sale_amount":1,"quote_public_sale_amount":0.5,"accepting_currencies":"","country_origin":"US","pre_sale_start_date":null,"pre_sale_end_date":null,"whitelist_url":"","whitelist_start_date":null,"whitelist_end_date":null,"bounty_detail_url":"","amount_for_sale":"500000000.0","kyc_required":true,"whitelist_available":null,"pre_sale_available":null,"pre_sale_ended":false},"watchlist_portfolio_users":28146,"market_cap_rank":402,"coingecko_rank":42,"coingecko_score":51.784,"developer_score":82.958,"community_score":38.196,"liquidity_score":45.553,"public_interest_score":0.037,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":88505,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-11T02:53:33.387Z"}
