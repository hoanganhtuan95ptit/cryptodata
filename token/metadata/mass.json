Nodes use storage capacity to run the consensus protocol and do not require permission. The MASS consensus engine is fair and energy efficient; only a very small amount of computing resources are required, meaning everyone has the chance to participate.\r\n\r\nMASS Net is the first public chain to make use of the MASS consensus engine. MASS is the store of value in circulation in MASS Net, and is also the value anchor for the MASS consensus engine.\r\n\r\nThe MASS community is a non-profit online organisation that works for the popularisation of blockchain technology. It was launched in 2017 by Dr. Ren Ling.\r\n"},"links":{"homepage":["https://massnet.org/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://www.massexplorer.org/","","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discordapp.com/invite/Ffk4VFS","",""],"announcement_url":["https://mpool.net/mpool",""],"twitter_screen_name":"massnetorg","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":5230593,"telegram_channel_identifier":"massnetorg","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/massnetorg"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/11047/thumb/mass.png?1587531471","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/11047/small/mass.png?1587531471","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/11047/large/mass.png?1587531471"},"country_origin":"CN","genesis_date":null,"sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":1147,"market_cap_rank":2645,"coingecko_rank":2586,"coingecko_score":12.471,"developer_score":0,"community_score":8.215,"liquidity_score":1,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":1313625,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-14T00:33:29.382Z"}
