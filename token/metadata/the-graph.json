GRT is an ERC20 token. Node operators, called Indexers, stake and earn GRT for processing queries. Anyone can delegate GRT to Indexers to secure the network and earn rewards. Curators organize data on The Graph by signaling GRT on useful APIs, called subgraphs. Indexers, Delegators, and Curators work together to organize the data for the crypto economy and maintain a useful global API for DeFi and Web3.\r\n"},"links":{"homepage":["https://thegraph.com/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xc944e90c64b2c07662a292be6244bdf05cda44a7","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xc944e90c64b2c07662a292be6244bdf05cda44a7","https://polygonscan.com/token/0x5fe2b58c013d7601147dcdd68c143a77499f5531","https://arbiscan.io/token/0x9623063377AD1B27544C965cCd7342f7EA7e88C7","https://snowtrace.io/token/0x8a0cac13c7da965a312f08ea4229c37869e85cb9","https://avascan.info/blockchain/c/address/0x8a0cac13c7da965a312f08ea4229c37869e85cb9/token","https://explorer.energi.network/token/0x771513ba693d457df3678c951c448701f2eaaad5","https://nearblocks.io/token/c944e90c64b2c07662a292be6244bdf05cda44a7.factory.bridge.near","https://arbiscan.io/token/0x9623063377ad1b27544c965ccd7342f7ea7e88c7",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/vtvv7FP","",""],"announcement_url":["https://thegraph.com/blog/",""],"twitter_screen_name":"graphprotocol","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"graphprotocol","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/thegraph","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node","https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-ts","https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-cli"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/13397/thumb/Graph_Token.png?1608145566","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/13397/small/Graph_Token.png?1608145566","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/13397/large/Graph_Token.png?1608145566"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0xc944e90c64b2c07662a292be6244bdf05cda44a7","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":68.57,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":31.43,"watchlist_portfolio_users":169799,"market_cap_rank":41,"coingecko_rank":21,"coingecko_score":55.819,"developer_score":85.012,"community_score":40.332,"liquidity_score":51.77,"public_interest_score":0.029,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-11T03:19:12.210Z"}
