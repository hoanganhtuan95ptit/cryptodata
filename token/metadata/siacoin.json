","ja":"","zh":"","zh-tw":"","ko":"시아코인은 스토리지 부분(클라우드 서비스)을 블록체인화 시킨 코인입니다. 간단히 말해, 사람들이 사용하지 않는 저장공간을 공유하면, 이를 합쳐 하나의 거대한 저장공간을 만들고 필요한 사람에게 제공합니다. 기존에 이와 비슷한 클라우드 서비스는 보통 하나의 기업인 제 3자에 의해 실행되었는데, 이는 남용이나 보안 문제가 있습니다. 하지만 시아코인은 블록체인과 스마트컨트랙트을 통해 시스템을 분산화하고 암호화시켜 이 문제들을 해결했습니다. \r\n\r\n시아코인의 아이디어는 2013년 HackMIT 2013 에서 사용하지 않는 저장공간을 활용하는 방법이 없을까 하는 단순한 생각에서 시작되었다고 합니다. 사람들은 자신의 하드디스크 중 일부(최소 10GB)를 일정 기간(최소 13주) 동안 대여하면 사용료를 시아코인으로 받을 수 있습니다. 반대로 클라우드를 사용하기 위한 비용은 매우 저렴합니다. \r\n\r\n코인 특징\r\n1. 시아코인의 스토리지는 특정 사용자에게서 직접 구매하는 방식이 아닌, 네트워크에 공유되어 분리된 디스크를 사용하는 방식입니다. 쉽게 말해, 토렌트처럼 파일의 조각들이 여러 노드 사이에 흩어져 분리되어있고, 이들이 암호화되어서 배포됩니다. 따라서, 스토리지를 빌려준 사용자도 자기 디스크에 들어 있는 파일이 어떤 내용인지 알 수 없고, 따라서 보안상으로 안전합니다. 본인의 키가 없으면 외부 세력이 접근할 수 없다는 점이 기존 클라우딩 시스템과 차별화되는 부분입니다. \r\n\r\n2. 저장할 공간을 임대해서 사용하거나 타인에게 임대하는 것 이외에도 채굴, 즉 저장공간을 거래하는 과정에서 사용되는 시아코인의 시스템을 유지하는 일을 해 시아코인을 얻을 수도 있습니다. 블록당 채굴 보상은 30만 코인으로 시작해 블록 당 3만 시아코인으로 안정화 될 때까지 블록마다 1 시아코인만큼씩 감소합니다. \r\n\r\n3. 거래와 채굴 시 이용되는 시아코인말고 사용되는 화폐로써 시아펀드(Siafund)가 있습니다. 성공적인 스토리지 계약 지급금의 3.9 %가 항상 시아펀드 보유자에게 돌아갑니다. 총 10,000개의 시아펀드가 있으며, 이중 약 90%는 시아의 모기업인 Nebulous Inc.가 가지고 시아의 발전을 위해 자금을 사용합니다. 이렇게 개발팀을 유지하고 프로젝트 모금을 조달하기 위해 만들어진 자산이 시아펀드입니다. \r\n\r\n핵심 가치\r\n(키워드: 가격경쟁력, 네트워크 효과, 스마트컨트랙트)\r\n\r\n1. 가격경쟁력: 아마존 S3나 드랍박스 같은 다른 스토리지 회사들보다 저렴하게 동질의 서비스를 이용할 수 있다는 장점이 있습니다. 현재 아마존은 1TB에 월당 $23인데, 시아코인은 $2로, 1/10의 가격입니다. 소량(10GB)을 빌렸을 때는 구글 컴퓨팅엔진의 디스크 사용료보다는 비싼 듯하지만, 100GB를 넘어가면서부터는 오히려 비용이 저렴해집니다. \r\n\r\n2. 네트워크 효과: 이용자와 자료가 많아질수록 느려지는 기존 시스템과 달리, 참여자가 많을수록 제공되는 저장공간 또한 늘어나기 때문에 속도와 성능이 더 좋아집니다. \r\n\r\n3. 스마트컨트랙트: 비슷한 코인으로 스토리지(SJCX)가 있는데, 이 프로그램은 pay-as-you-go 모델로 사용자가 없으면 호스터가 더 돈을 벌지 못합니다. 이와 달리 시아코인은 스마트컨트랙트에 기초해 저장공간을 제공하는 한 항상 돈을 받을 수 있도록 지원한다는 장점이 있습니다.

This means reaching out to large companies like Netflix and Dropbox to hopefully be able to be their storage and distribution framework.
