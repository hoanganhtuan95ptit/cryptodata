This will continue every iterative 2x of the token value.","sl":"What is the project about?\r\n\r\nLilAI is on a mission to revolutionize community management by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence. Our vision is to create a future where managing communities is seamless and communities thrive, powered by the cutting-edge technology of LilAI. We believe that the collective imagination, energy, and passion of our users will fuel this revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat makes your project unique?\r\n\r\nLilAI will deliver an intuitive, efficient, and effective solution for Telegram and Discord that will help communities thrive. Our platform will offer several key features, including:\r\n\r\nAnswering questions about the project and roadmap based on machine learning\r\nEnsuring compliance with community guidelines\r\nTracking positive contributions from community members for possible future rewards\r\nAllowing for admin-controlled tone calibration (e.g. hype, enthusiasm, sarcasm)\r\nCombating FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt)\r\nUsing daily/monthly analysis to generate visual memes for the community to share\r\nMaking suggestions for community-led marketing campaigns\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat’s next for your project?\r\n\r\nAny start up in crypto knows that the community becomes the heart and core of the project. Hiring multiple community managers with experience to cover all time zones can become an expensive quest. Beside cryptocurrencies projects, LilAI aim to find its utility in any business which requires community management. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can your token be used for?\r\n\r\nEvery community that utilizes LilAI must market-purchase $lilAI at market value, with the quantity dependent on the community size. This will be locked for the duration of their contract. In addition, the project must give the LilAI Treasury $5000 of their native token. If the token doubles in value while in the custody of LilAI, $5000 will be sold to market-buy $LilAI and locked in the project Treasury. This will continue every iterative 2x of the token value."},"links":{"homepage":["https://lilai.co","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://arbiscan.io/address/0x655a6beebf2361a19549a99486ff65f709bd2646","https://arbiscan.io/token/0x655a6beebf2361a19549a99486ff65f709bd2646","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["","https://medium.com/@lilTheAI",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"lilTheAI","facebook_username":null,"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"LilAICommunity","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/30621/thumb/LogoLilai_CoinGecko.png?1685772677","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/30621/small/LogoLilai_CoinGecko.png?1685772677","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/30621/large/LogoLilai_CoinGecko.png?1685772677"},"country_origin":null,"genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0x655a6beebf2361a19549a99486ff65f709bd2646","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":62,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":null,"coingecko_score":0,"developer_score":0,"community_score":0,"liquidity_score":0,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-13T09:52:38.563Z"}
