Unlike competing DeFi lenders, Piggy runs liquidations by making use of a Stability Pool mechanism instead of auctions, which allows it to make more efficient use of capital and offer loans with minimum collateral ratios as low as 110%.\r\nLoans on Piggy are drawn in $PUSD, a dollar-pegged stablecoin. Any user (borrower or otherwise), can deposit $PUSD in the Stability Pool to become a Stability Provider and earn $PIGGY rewards while doing so.
