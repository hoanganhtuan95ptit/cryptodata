The first stablecoin to be released is sEURO which will be released using an initial bonding curve (IBCO) mechanism. The Standard will launch its full suite of smart contracts on the ZK-EVM but its current MVP is running on L1 Ethereum. * Lock up assets and borrow at 0% interest with no pay off time limit. * Sell your debt as an NFT if you can not afford to pay off your loan but need liquidity. * Trade locked-up assets within the smart vault. This means if you have borrowed against locked Ethereum and you think LINK will pump then you can swap the eth for an equal amount of LINK. * you hold your keys, no third party can touch your assets unless you fall under collateral. * TheStandard will be one of the first dapps running on the polygon ZK-EVM when it launches its main net. * Smart contracts are fully audited by Zokyo labs."},"links":{"homepage":["https://thestandard.io/","https://app.thestandard.io",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b93b9e90ab887e53f9fb8728c009746e989b53","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xa0b93b9e90ab887e53f9fb8728c009746e989b53","https://polygonscan.com/token/0xe342ebb6a56cd3dbf0fe01a447fe367b9290ecf8","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["https://www.instagram.com/thestandard.io/","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/thestandard-io-836907456743079956","https://blog.thestandard.io","https://www.facebook.com/thestandard.io/"],"announcement_url":["https://blog.thestandard.io/",""],"twitter_screen_name":"thestandard_io","facebook_username":"thestandard.io","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"TheStandard_io","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/the-standard"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/20598/thumb/TheStandard-logo_variation-01.png?1668676004","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/20598/small/TheStandard-logo_variation-01.png?1668676004","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/20598/large/TheStandard-logo_variation-01.png?1668676004"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0xa0b93b9e90ab887e53f9fb8728c009746e989b53","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":154,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":6047,"coingecko_score":1.801,"developer_score":0,"community_score":8.186,"liquidity_score":0,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-10T23:10:21.660Z"}
