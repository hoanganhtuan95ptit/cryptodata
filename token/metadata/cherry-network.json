These advanced features come prebuilt in our core and are accessible on other blockchains through Cherry’s interoperability channels. Decentralized applications built on Cherry or many of the most renowned decentralized networks can now leverage Cherry’s features to augment their dApps. Most of the complexities of building-integrated web3 applications handling data are, thus, abstracted away to the core, allowing smart contract developers to rely on a rich base layer toolkit, and ultimately focus on best serving their customers."},"links":{"homepage":["https://www.cherry.network/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xa20f77b7ad5a88badc48800c56507b7274c06fdc","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xa20f77b7ad5a88badc48800c56507b7274c06fdc","https://bscscan.com/token/0x8f36cc333f55b09bb71091409a3d7ade399e3b1c","https://polygonscan.com/token/0x8f36cc333f55b09bb71091409a3d7ade399e3b1c","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.com/invite/KAwC9aafWa","https://www.linkedin.com/company/cherrynetwork/",""],"announcement_url":["https://blog.cherry.network/",""],"twitter_screen_name":"Cherry_Network","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"cherrynetwork","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/CherryNetwork"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/21855/thumb/cherry.PNG?1640144127","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/21855/small/cherry.PNG?1640144127","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/21855/large/cherry.PNG?1640144127"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0xa20f77b7ad5a88badc48800c56507b7274c06fdc","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":100,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":0,"watchlist_portfolio_users":4349,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":4619,"coingecko_score":3.724,"developer_score":0,"community_score":9.611,"liquidity_score":8.049,"public_interest_score":0.001,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-12T10:37:10.921Z"}
