Any digital asset which uses cryptographic keys can benefit from upgrading to using quantum keys. This in turn leads to the creation of a new class of digital assets. Presently, test networks for Quantum Bitcoin and Quantum Ethereum exist with more protocols to follow. A multiverse of quantum assets each denoted by the prefix Quantum is in the works. Users can expect to be able to use Quantum BTC and Quantum ETH in the near future.\r\n\r\nImportantly, holders of Quantum Assets Tokens (QA) at relevant blocks are guaranteed airdrops of new quantum assets as they are released to market."},"links":{"homepage":["https://quantumassets.vg/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://bscscan.com/token/0x4ef29F3B804C316bA8bA464A765C601Fc092a2e9","","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["","",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"QuantumAssetsQA","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"quantumassets","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/18194/thumb/QA-logo-coinMarketCap.png?1630913079","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/18194/small/QA-logo-coinMarketCap.png?1630913079","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/18194/large/QA-logo-coinMarketCap.png?1630913079"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0x4ef29f3b804c316ba8ba464a765c601fc092a2e9","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":161,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":4645,"coingecko_score":3.637,"developer_score":0,"community_score":6.971,"liquidity_score":10.52,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-11T01:00:31.808Z"}
