The blockchain security auditing platform is powered by Cryptyk Tokens (CTK) that are automatically  acquired by cloud storage users who pay in fiat (USD or Euro) with a portion converted into CTK Tokens to pay for security auditing functions. Hence CTK is a true utility token.\r\n\r\nThe result is a hybrid decentralized cloud design that offers the speed and scalability of the major centralized cloud vendors, the security and privacy of a 100% decentralized design, and the immutable permanence of blockchain for auditing and tracking capabilities. Cryptyk's crypto powered cloud storage platform represents the first decentralized technology that can truly compete head-on with centralized vendors like Google or Amazon."},"links":{"homepage":["https://cryptyk.io/","",""],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x42a501903afaa1086b5975773375c80e363f4063","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x42a501903afaa1086b5975773375c80e363f4063","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://www.facebook.com/cryptyk/","",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"TeamCryptyk","facebook_username":"cryptyk","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2837930,"telegram_channel_identifier":"cryptyk","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2729/thumb/th.jpg?1667122361","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2729/small/th.jpg?1667122361","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2729/large/th.jpg?1667122361"},"country_origin":"US","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0x42a501903afaa1086b5975773375c80e363f4063","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"ico_data":{"ico_start_date":"2018-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","ico_end_date":"2018-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","short_desc":"Decentralized Cloud Storage with Blockchain Security","description":null,"links":{},"softcap_currency":"USD","hardcap_currency":"USD","total_raised_currency":"USD","softcap_amount":"3000000.0","hardcap_amount":"25000000.0","total_raised":"21875000.0","quote_pre_sale_currency":"USD","base_pre_sale_amount":"1.0","quote_pre_sale_amount":"0.1","quote_public_sale_currency":"USD","base_public_sale_amount":1,"quote_public_sale_amount":0.125,"accepting_currencies":"BTC,ETH,USD","country_origin":"US","pre_sale_start_date":"2018-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","pre_sale_end_date":"2018-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","whitelist_url":"https://www.cryptyk.io/verification/","whitelist_start_date":null,"whitelist_end_date":null,"bounty_detail_url":"","amount_for_sale":"250000000.0","kyc_required":true,"whitelist_available":true,"pre_sale_available":true,"pre_sale_ended":false},"watchlist_portfolio_users":207,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":6009,"coingecko_score":1.82,"developer_score":0,"community_score":7.564,"liquidity_score":0.781,"public_interest_score":0,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":5236621,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-12T11:04:50.310Z"}
