Events like airdrops, giveaways are raided by bots and there is an unfair distribution of prizes that ultimately diminishes all interest of participants in these giveaways. In addition to this, there is currently no option for rewarding users on dynamic activities that are being performed by the users on the organization's website, causing lesser and lesser conversions, and hence most of the users liquidate their tokens.
