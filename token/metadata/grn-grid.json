The Grid is built utilising a novel approach to Proof of Stake with logarithmic weighted stake-voting rights and locked security pools. The weighting causes a progressive payout of validating rewards and is an industry first. These approach is chosen to counter two main drawbacks of PoS based consensus, namely decentralisation and accumulation of wealth by the top holders.\r\n\r\nGrid is widely interoperable with existing libraries in the blockchain industry, while also implementing key features for easier transition from other (de) centralized technologies. Included among these features are an integrated payment and escrow system, exchanging pools, and encrypted communications.
