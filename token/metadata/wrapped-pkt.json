Cjdns enables people who have the internet to be a gateway to the internet for people to get access to the internet without paying a centralized ISP (you can connect P2P through other cjdns gateway nodes).\r\n\r\n(Part of) PHASE 1 of PKT is people monetizing their internet connections (happening now through mining). (Part of) PHASE 2 is gateways being able to provide local internet access to their neighbors via localized mesh networks (worldwide) using cjdns technology.\r\n\r\nPKT also has a Network Steward, which is a wallet addresses elected by POS vote, where 20% of each mined block is paid, and 100% of the funds are granted to the community every 90 days to build open source technology for the network, or else the coins are burned. Over 10% of the mined coin supply has been burned to date.\r\n\""},"links":{"homepage":["https://pkt.cash","https://odapp.io/",""],"blockchain_site":["https://bscscan.com/token/0x1c25222994531c4ac35e4d94bbf7552c9aa92e32","https://explorer.pkt.cash/","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://www.facebook.com/pktcash","https://discord.gg/zfmdRNxh",""],"announcement_url":["",""],"twitter_screen_name":"pkt_cash","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":5283439,"telegram_channel_identifier":"pkt_cash","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/PKTcash/","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/pkt-cash/"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/19003/thumb/200x200wpkt-04.png?1634138697","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/19003/small/200x200wpkt-04.png?1634138697","large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/19003/large/200x200wpkt-04.png?1634138697"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0x1c25222994531c4ac35e4d94bbf7552c9aa92e32","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":400,"market_cap_rank":null,"coingecko_rank":4151,"coingecko_score":5.114,"developer_score":0,"community_score":22.338,"liquidity_score":1,"public_interest_score":0.001,"public_interest_stats":{"alexa_rank":null,"bing_matches":null},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2023-07-08T19:35:00.952Z"}
